## 📊**Week in Numbers**

This week, we found 24 early-stage deals totalling $252.9M without counting Grammarly. This included 20 deals in the Bay Area with 7 Series A rounds, 13 Seed rounds, and 2 pre-seed rounds. Wednesday happened to be the busiest day, with two-thirds of the companies mentioned having AI critical to their tech. 

Please note that we're still working on building our data pipelines to identify pre-seed rounds as they come. 

### 🔍 What Stands Out

  * **AI Dominance** : AI still remains a significant focus, with substantial investments in apps for infrastructure, productivity tools, and specialized fields. 

  * **Enterprise Software Surge** : There is a growing demand for enterprise AI tools that enhance productivity and compliance within large organizations. 

  * **Diverse Sector Growth** : Beyond AI, sectors like gaming, mixed reality, and sustainable manufacturing are also experiencing substantial investment activity.
