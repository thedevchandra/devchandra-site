Welcome to the week where Trump convinced China to sell TikTok for the price of a mid-tier SaaS acquisition, Jensen Huang decided to become the Federal Reserve of AI, and Apple quietly built a ChatGPT clone while pretending Siri isn't five years behind. 

###### As we continue to build at [Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/), we've launched [Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/) with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter.

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **TikTok 's Fire Sale:** Trump signed an executive order blessing the $14B deal, giving Oracle, Silver Lake & friends 80% of TikTok 

  * **Chip Tariff Insanity:** Trump wants tech companies to match every imported chip with a U.S.-made one or face massive tariffs, so good luck finding those American fabs 

  * **Nvidia 's $100B Power Move:** Jensen Huang committed nine figures to OpenAI while bankrolling the entire AI stack, basically becoming VC with a GPU side hustle 

  * **OpenAI 's Enterprise Push:** Struck $100M deal with Databricks and launched "Pulse" morning briefs for $200/month users 

  * **Apple 's Secret Sauce:** Built an internal ChatGPT clone called "Veritas" (Latin for truth, ironic much?) to test their Siri reboot coming March 2026 




## 🏛️ America's New State Capitalism: TikTok Fire Sales & Chip Tariff Insanity

[The White House: Saving Tiktok While Protecting National Security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/saving-tiktok-while-protecting-national-security/)

### 💸 TikTok's $14B Government-Mandated Bargain

Trump has signed an executive order blessing a [$14B TikTok spinout](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/technology/trump-tiktok-ban-deal.html) to a consortium of Oracle, Silver Lake, Rupert Murdoch's Fox, Michael Dell, and, surprisingly, UAE fund MGX, which will control 80% of TikTok's U.S. operations. 

**The Numbers Don 't Add Up:**

  * **Previous valuations:** $40-60B just months ago 

  * **Sale price:** $14B (a 75% haircut) 

  * **ByteDance 's take:** Less than 20% equity, but somehow still gets 50% of profits through "licensing arrangements"

  * **Board control:** 6 of 7 seats go to Americans, with Oracle managing the algorithm 




**The real story?** Trump secured this during talks with Xi Jinping, who apparently decided that getting _something_ for TikTok beats getting banned entirely. Analysts are calling it ["the most undervalued tech acquisition of the decade"](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/donald-trumps-tiktok-deal-looks-like-crony-capitalism), while others see it as textbook crony capitalism. 

### 🏭 Match Every Chip or Pay Up: The New Semiconductor Shakedown

The Trump admin is cooking up a [semiconductor tariff scheme](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-chip-tariffs-exemptions-90fa2ab3) to require tech companies to match every imported chip with a domestically made one, or face crushing penalties. 

**The Insane Requirements:**

  * **1:1 ratio:** For every chip you import, make one in America 

  * **No U.S. production?** Enjoy your 100% tariffs 

  * **" Credits" for promises:** Pledge to build a fab, get temporary exemption 

  * **Supply chain nightmare:** Track every chip in every component of every product 




**Who Wins:** TSMC's Arizona fab (suddenly very valuable), GlobalFoundries (one of the few with U.S. capacity), and lawyers who'll track all this compliance. 

**Who Loses:** Apple (good luck making M-series chips in Ohio), every electronics company, and consumers ready for $3,000 base model iPhones. 

**The Bigger Picture:** As the WSJ notes, "capitalism in America is starting to look like China," as the US Govt can force foreign companies to sell at fire-sale prices to politically connected buyers while mandating domestic production ratios. 

## 🤖 The AI Industrial Complex: Everyone's Building, Nobody's Profiting

[NVIDIA, OpenAI Announce ‘the Biggest AI Infrastructure Deployment in History’](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/openai-nvidia/)

### 💰 Nvidia's $100B Power Play: Becoming the Fed of AI

[Nvidia is committing $100B to OpenAI](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/jensen-huang-using-nvidia-cash-rule-ai-economy) while quietly becoming the financial backbone of the entire AI economy. Jensen Huang isn't just selling GPUs—he's financing his own customers to buy more GPUs in the most brilliant/insane circular economy ever created. 

**The Full Portfolio:**

  * **$100B to OpenAI:** Ensuring they keep buying H200s forever 

  * **$6.3B backstop to CoreWeave:** Funding the cloud that buys Nvidia chips 

  * **Multibillion deals with Lambda:** Another GPU cloud needing hardware 

  * **Intel pieces acquired:** Snapping up the fallen giant's scraps 




**The Infinite Money Glitch:** Invest in AI companies → They need GPUs → Sell them GPUs → Use profits to invest in more AI companies → Repeat until $4.3T valuation or heat death of the universe, whichever comes first. 

### 🤝 OpenAI's Enterprise Sprint: $100M Deals & $200/Month Morning Briefs

OpenAI is desperately trying to justify its existence beyond a "chatbot that occasionally tells users they can fly" with two more enterprise moves this week. 

**The Databricks Deal:** OpenAI and Databricks signed a [$100M partnership](https://www.wsj.com/articles/openai-and-databricks-strike-100-million-deal-to-sell-ai-agents-f7d79b3f) to help enterprises build AI agents. GPT-5 will be directly available to Databricks' 20,000 customers, promising 95% accuracy (meaning your AI will only hallucinate 1 in 20 times). 

**ChatGPT Pulse:** OpenAI launched [Pulse](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/openai-launches-chatgpt-pulse-to-proactively-write-you-morning-briefs/), a $200/month feature that generates personalized morning briefs while you sleep. It's so compute-intensive that they can only offer it to Pro subscribers and are building five new data centers with Oracle just to power it. 

### 🍎 Apple's Secret ChatGPT Clone: Project Veritas

Apple is quietly testing [Veritas](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-26/apple-builds-a-chatgpt-like-app-to-help-test-the-revamped-siri), an internal ChatGPT clone to prep for Siri's March 2026 reboot. Named after the Latin word for "truth," it's designed to test features such as screen reading, email sorting, and in-app actions. Sadly, Siri should've been able to do this five years ago. 

**The Reality:** Apple is building internal chatbots just to understand how chatbots work. Built on their new "Linwood" LLM framework (using both in-house and third-party models), it's Apple's admission that they're so far behind in AI. 

### 🔍 The Search Wars: Perplexity Takes on Google's Monopoly

[Perplexity launched a search API](https://venturebeat.com/ai/perplexity-launches-massive-search-api-to-take-on-googles-dominance/) giving devs access to hundreds of billions of web pages, declaring war on Google's search infrastructure monopoly. Perplexity wants to be the search backend for everyone else. 

**The Pile-On:** Ollama also launched a search API this week, while Glean and Algolia fight for enterprise search. Meanwhile, ChatGPT Pulse might just replace search altogether by proactively answering questions you haven't asked yet. 

**Why This Matters:** Every AI company needs web data, Google controls most of it, and everyone's scrambling for alternatives. Building a search index costs billions, maintaining it costs more, and Google has a 25-year head start. 

## ⚡ Startup Quick Hits: When GPU Wars Meet Sovereign Dreams

**☁️** [Nscale's $1.1B "Neocloud" Fantasy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-25/ai-startup-nscale-raises-1-1-billion-for-data-center-expansion): London startup raised Series B led by Aker ($285M for 9.3% stake) with Nvidia joining the party. They're calling themselves a "neocloud" provider, which is just fancy talk for "we rent GPUs."

🎯 [Cohere's $7B Consolation Prize](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/cohere-hits-7b-valuation-a-month-after-its-last-raise-partners-with-amd/): Added $100M to August's $500M round, hitting $7B valuation (up from $6.8B). Co-founder helped write the transformer paper that started this whole mess, yet they're worth 1/70th of OpenAI. 

🦑 [Kraken's $20B Pre-IPO Pump](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/26/kraken-raises-usd500m-in-funding-round-valuing-crypto-exchange-at-usd15b-fortune)**:** Crypto exchange in talks for another $200-300M at $20B valuation, just after closing $500M at $15B. Setting up for 2026 IPO after acquiring NinjaTrader for $1.5B. Four executives fled ahead of the offering. 

🔧 [Modular's $1.6B Switzerland Play](https://www.wired.com/story/semiconductor-software-startups-chips/)**:** Raised $250M led by US Innovative Technology Fund for their "run AI anywhere" platform. Promising to break Nvidia's CUDA stranglehold by making code portable across GPUs. The pitch: be the neutral Switzerland of AI chips. 

🤖 [Factory's $50M for "Droids" That Actually Code](https://www.ft.com/content/b73ea5a0-4bfe-498f-9d61-514d75941638)**:** Raised Series B at $300M valuation from Sequoia, NEA, Nvidia, and JP Morgan. Their "Droids" don't just autocomplete; they handle entire workflows like migrations, debugging, and documentation. 

## 💰 Investor Quick Hits: From Dropout Dreams to Dynasty Dollars

**🎓** **[YC's Launches Early Decision](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/y-combinator-launches-early-decision-for-students-who-want-to-graduate-first-build-later/)****:** Y Combinator’s new program lets college kids secure funding and a YC spot while still in school, then defer until after graduation. A complete 180 from the dropout-or-bust gospel they've preached for years.

**✝️**[**Peter Thiel 's Antichrist Investment Thesis**](https://www.wsj.com/tech/peter-thiel-and-the-antichrist-bd68312e)**:** Thiel is hosting a closed four-part lecture series in SF about biblical prophecies and how existential risks (nuclear war, bioweapons, autonomous AI) lead to a one-world totalitarian government, aka the Antichrist.

🚀 **[Ex-Sequoia's Matt Miller Bags $400M for Evantic](https://sifted.eu/articles/ex-sequoia-partner-matt-miller-400m-fund)****:** After 12 years at Sequoia (with a messy Klarna board stint), Miller closed his London-based B2B AI fund with 140 founders/ operators as LPs. He is allocating up to 50% of carry to LPs who help portfolio companies. 

👑 **[Draper Dynasty's 4th Gen Raises $87M](https://fortune.com/2025/09/29/adam-draper-boost-vc-crypto-bitcoin-venture-capital/)****:** Adam Draper closed Boost VC's fourth fund for pre-seed, backed by family offices including his dad, grandfather, and cousin. The pressure of losing your cousin's money apparently trumps losing institutional LPs'.

🤖 **[Touring Capital's $330M CVC Fund](https://fortune.com/2025/09/25/exclusive-touring-capital-founded-by-ex-m12-and-softbank-investors-closes-330-million-first-fund/)****:** Ex-Microsoft M12 and SoftBank Vision Fund partners closed their debut fund, citing an MIT study showing 95% of AI pilots fail. Their angle is that they know why corporate AI fails because they watched it happen from inside.

## 💸 IPO & M&A; Quick Hits: From Gaming Kingdoms to Shopping

**🎮** [EA's $55B Saudi Takeover](https://news.ea.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-55-Billion/default.aspx)**:** Saudi PIF, Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners are taking Electronic Arts private at $210/share in the largest LBO ever. The Kingdom already owns 9.9% and is doubling down on gaming for "soft power."

**🛍️** [eBay Acquires Gen Z Thrift Shop Tise](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/ebay-to-acquire-social-marketplace-platform-tise/)**:** The auction dinosaur bought Norwegian social marketplace Tise (raised $45M) to pretend it's Depop. First invested via eBay Ventures in 2022, now buying the whole thing to get those sweet Gen Z engagement metrics. 

🧠 [MentalHealth.com Buys Therapy.ai](https://www.mentalhealth.com/news/mentalhealth-com-acquires-therapy-ai)**:** The platform acquired AI therapy startup to "augment care and strengthen relationships" amid 23% of Americans facing AI therapy bans. The global mental health crisis costs $1T annually, but maybe it can be solved with chatbots? 

**📚** [Ignite Reading Acquires Esteam](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ignite-reading-acquires-esteam-to-help-human-tutors-leverage-ai-for-personalized-reading-instruction-302565162.html)**:** The virtual tutoring platform bought AI education startup Esteam to "end the literacy crisis" with automatic speech recognition. Now AI can listen to kids struggle with reading in real-time and generate "precise skill maps."
