Things keep getting spicy in AI this week. 

Anthropic's biggest customer just hired away their key talent, two companies simultaneously launched $200/month tiers, and Apple's considering outsourcing Siri. The drama continues, and the stakes keep getting higher. 

###### As we continue to build at [Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/), we've launched [Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/) with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter.

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **Awkward for Anthropic** : Its biggest customer just poached two star employees 

  * **Pricing Wars Escalate:** Everyone's suddenly charging $200/month for premium AI features 

  * **Apple 's Identity Crisis:** Apple might finally admit Siri needs outside help to compete 

  * **VC Reality Check:** VC alpha generation is getting harder, while wealthy clients avoid the asset class 

  * **Wealth Wars Lost:** Private credit and real estate are winning the wealth wars against venture capital 




## 🎭 On This Week's Episode of "As the Bay Turns"

Boris Cherny on “[Mastering Claude Code in 30 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0)” 

### 🔥 When Your Biggest Customer Becomes Your Biggest Threat

Anthropic just hit a mind-blowing $4B ARR (4x growth since January), but here's the plot twist: their biggest customer just hired away two of their star employees: 

  * **The Drama:** Cursor, crushing it with **$500M+ ARR** and a $9.9B valuation, snagged Boris Cherny and Cat Wu, the brains behind Anthropic's competing Claude Code product. 

  * **The Awkwardness:** Cursor relies on Claude to power their product, but now they're building competing features using the same AI while employing the people who built Anthropic's version. 

  * **The Numbers:** Anthropic generates ~$333M monthly while burning $3B annually on AI infrastructure. Cursor doubled revenue growth since March and launched autonomous web/mobile agents. 




AI development has gotten so competitive that companies are willing to risk key partnerships to get top talent. With Windsurf exiting to OpenAI for $3B, Cursor is staying in the ring to compete. 

### 💰 The $200 AI* Club Just Got a Lot More Crowded

[Claude Max Plan](https://www.anthropic.com/news/max-plan)

Remember when $20/month felt steep for software? When OpenAI introduced Pro at $200/month, it seemed really high. Now those days are officially dead. 

**The Pattern:** AI pricing has three tiers: free (with painful limits), "SaaS-ish" $10-30 range, and "power user premium" at $200 for AI power users: 

  * **December 5, 2024 -**[ChatGPT Pro](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pro/)

  * **April 9, 2025 -**[Claude Max](https://www.anthropic.com/news/max-plan): Includes Claude Code, integrations, advanced research, global web search, and priority access. 

  * **June 16, 2025 -**[Cursor Ultra](https://cursor.com/blog/new-tier): Backed by multi-year partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI. 

  * **July 1, 2025 -**[Perplexity Max](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-max)**:** Offers unlimited Labs, early Comet browser access, top-tier models, and priority support. 




What started as OpenAI's expensive experiment has become the new industry standard in just seven months: 

  * **Autonomous Agents:** These tools crossed a critical threshold. They're handling entire workflows autonomously, not just simple queries. 

  * **Use It or Lose It:** Perfect time to use these models aggressively. You're getting way more value than you're paying for, especially with Claude Max. 

  * **The Strategy:** Hook users with immense value to drive retention, then dial back features or hope compute efficiency improves profitability. Heavy users are getting an incredible deal that may not last. 




### 🍎 Apple's AI Identity Crisis

Apple finds itself admitting it needs help. The company that builds everything in-house is considering [outsourcing Siri's brain to OpenAI or Anthropic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/apple-weighs-replacing-siri-s-ai-llms-with-anthropic-claude-or-openai-chatgpt). 

  * **Reality Check:** Internal testing showed Claude and ChatGPT outperform Apple's models. Siri's 2025 upgrade flopped, leadership reshuffled after morale plummeted. 

  * **Brain Drain:** Top AI talent jumps to Meta and OpenAI, who offer compensation packages Apple struggles to match. 

  * **The Stakes:** Potentially putting Claude or ChatGPT in front of 2B+ iPhone users. Anthropic (valued at $61.5B) getting the nod over OpenAI ($300B) would be ultimate David vs. Goliath. 

  * **The Catch:** Apple wants third-party models on their infrastructure for privacy. Anthropic demands multibillion-dollar annual fee. 




If the company that built its reputation on controlling user experience hands Siri's brain to a third party, it's a clear sign AI is too big to get wrong, even if it means swallowing decades of pride. 

## 🗳️ OpenAI vs Anthropic's Regulatory Showdown

Photo by [Harold Mendoza](https://unsplash.com/@haroldrmendoza?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/white-concrete-building-under-cloudy-sky-during-daytime-6xafY_AE1LM?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash)

OpenAI and Anthropic were on opposite sides of a major regulatory battle. The [US Senate killed a provision that would have banned states from regulating AI](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/us-senate-kills-10-year-ban-state-ai-regulation-trump-budget-bill?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=daily_pitch&sourceType=NEWSLETTER) for 10 years. 

  * **The Provision:** Sen. Ted Cruz's measure would have withheld federal broadband funding from states that regulated AI. VCs and AI CEOs lobbied heavily for it. 

  * **The Vote:** Senators killed it 99-1 Tuesday morning, with Sen. Thom Tillis as lone dissenter. 

  * **The Split:** OpenAI's Sam Altman supported the ban, arguing "regulatory patchwork" would slow progress. Anthropic's Dario Amodei opposed it, calling the moratorium "far too blunt" in a NYT op-ed. 

  * **The Stakes:** This comes as New York passed a bill requiring AI companies to publish safety protocols, exactly what the provision would have prevented. 




While OpenAI pushes for less regulation, Anthropic positions itself as the safety-conscious alternative and advocates for measured oversight. The AI industry's power struggles are spilling into DC. 

## 📊 The Venture Capital Reality Check

### 📈 The Hunt for Alpha in VC Just Got Harder (And More Rewarding)

[Level VC's new analysis reveals why generating alpha](https://levelvc.com/this-is-not-your-mothers-alpha/), those excess returns that separate great investors, has become both more challenging and more critical in venture capital. 

  * **Size Matters Less:** Structural inefficiencies favor smaller, nimble funds over large ones as markets become more efficient 

  * **Expertise Beats Trends:** Deep sector understanding beats following obvious trends in an increasingly crowded field 

  * **Network Effects Matter:** Non-redundant sourcing networks matter as founder ecosystems shift rapidly 

  * **Speed Plus Smarts:** Analytical edge combined with quick decision-making continues to provide advantages 




While alpha generation has become tougher, the rewards are bigger than ever, as companies stay private longer and achieve larger valuations before going public. 

### 💸 VC Loses the Wealth Wars Despite Creating Them

Fifteen years after AngelList democratized startup investing, [wealthy individuals are avoiding the very asset class](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vc-private-wealth-semi-liquid-funds?utm_source=confluencevcweekly.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=diversification-vs-concentration&_bhlid=e95ddb81edb54c16e0d8fee7be7ccde6bedbb9a4) that taught them about private markets. 

  * **The Preference Gap:** Only 26% of wealth advisers want VC allocations vs. 56% for private credit and 66% for private equity 

  * **Cash Flow Reality:** Private credit and real estate offer actual cash flows and shorter time horizons that wealthy clients prefer over VC's decade-long wait times 

  * **Selection Risk High:** Performance dispersion between top and bottom VC funds makes manager selection incredibly risky for advisers 

  * **The Liquidity Problem:** With institutional LPs tapped out, VC desperately needs the $150T wealth channel, but first must solve its fundamental liquidity problem 




The asset class that created modern wealth management is now losing to the alternatives it inspired.
