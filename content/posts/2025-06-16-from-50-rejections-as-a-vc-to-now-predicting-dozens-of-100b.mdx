Let's dive deeper into what is trending this past week in startups! 

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **AI Mega-Fund** : Felicis closes $900M fund betting on $100B+ AI companies. 

  * **Founder Comeback** : Anne Wojcicki bets her personal fortune to reclaim 23andMe. 

  * **Search Solved** : Glean hits $7.2B valuation solving enterprise file finding problem 

  * **Dev Tools Win** : Linear reaches unicorn status, making project management enjoyable. 

  * **Analytics Renaissance** : PostHog raises $70M from Stripe at $920M valuation 

  * **Fintech Efficiency** : Ramp hits $16B valuation while burning just $2M monthly. 

  * **No-Code Rumor Mill** : Lovable is raising $100M for its “vibe coding” platform. 




## 💰 Felicis Goes All-In on AI's $100B Fantasy

Believe it or not, Felicis Ventures founder Aydin Senkut survived 50 straight "nos" when raising his first fund in 2009. Now, Felicis just [raised a monster $900M Fund X](https://fortune.com/2025/06/12/exclusive-felicis-has-raised-900-million-tenth-fund/), making the bold prediction that "dozens of $100B+ AI companies will emerge this decade," not just the usual unicorn or decacorn, but full-blown centacorns. 

Senkut has put his money where his mouth is with over 70% of the portfolio now consisting of AI-native startups, including Runway, Supabase, and Poolside. With AI companies snagging 58% of all VC dollars in Q1 2025 ($73B out of $126B total), he is betting that we're still in the early innings of the biggest tech transformation in history. 

## 🧬 Anne Wojcicki Bets Her Fortune on 23andMe's Genetic Resurrection

Last year, 23andMe torched $666M and was on the verge of going bankrupt. Now, Anne Wojcicki just pulled off the ultimate founder comeback story to buy it back by [outbidding Big Pharma giant Regeneron with a $305M offer](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/16/23andme-anne-wojcicki) to buy back her bankrupt genetics company. 

After Regeneron initially won the bankruptcy auction for $265M, the deal sparked lawsuits from 27 state attorneys general worried about customer data privacy. So Wojcicki fought to reopen bidding, put her entire fortune on the line, and emerged victorious when Regeneron's CEO bluntly told CNBC, "the juice isn't worth the squeeze."

## 🔍 Glean's Search Party Just Got $2.6B Bigger

Enterprise search startup [Glean just raised a $150M Series F](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/ai-powered-work-assistant-glean-valuation-jumps/) at a whopping $7.2B valuation, a $2.6B jump in less than a year. The six-year-old Palo Alto company has cracked the code on something every office worker desperately needs: AI-powered search that actually finds that important email buried somewhere between Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and your overflowing Slack channels. With ARR already surpassing $100M just three years post-launch, Glean is proving that solving the search issue is worth billions in a world drowning in digital clutter. 

### 📋 Linear Finally Makes Project Management Cool

Project management startup [Linear just secured $82M in a Series C](https://techfundingnews.com/linear-rockets-to-unicorn-status-82m-series-c-fuels-1-25b-valuation-in-jira-showdown/) round led by Accel at a $1.25B valuation, officially joining the unicorn club. It did the impossible: making developers actually want to use project management software, mostly fed up with Jira. 

The raise rewards Linear's relentless focus on speed and simplicity, winning over 15,000+ enterprise customers, including OpenAI, Scale AI, and Perplexity. With profits up 280% in the past year and just 80 remote employees, Linear proves that the best way to beat a household name is to be fast, beautiful, enjoyable, and better than Jira. 

## 📊 PostHog's $70M Stripe-Led Round Makes Analytics Sexy Again

Open-source analytics darling [PostHog just closed a $70M Series D led by Stripe](https://posthog.com/blog/series-d), hitting a $920M "unicorn adjacent" valuation. The five-year-old company has won over 176,000 companies with its developer-first approach to product analytics, including an impressive 54% of Y Combinator's latest batch. With their ambitious "customer infrastructure" vision to replace entire data tool stacks and a CAC payback period of just five days, PostHog is proving that being open-source doesn't mean leaving money on the table. 

## 💳 Ramp's $200M Rocket Ship Hits $16B While Burning Just $2M Monthly

Corporate spend management platform Ramp just [raised $200M at a $16B valuation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-13/ramp-hits-16-billion-valuation-in-new-funding-round) led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. This caps off one of fintech's most impressive efficiency stories as the six-year-old company scales to $700M in ARR while burning less than $2M per month thanks to AI automation. Ramp has 30,000+ customers, including Poshmark, Anduril, and Notion, who process $55B in annual payment volume. 

## 🛠️ Rumor Mill: From Zero to Lovable in Zero Lines of Code

Swedish AI startup Lovable is [reportedly raising $100M at a $1.5B valuation](https://techfundingnews.com/swedens-lovable-takes-on-cursor-and-copilot-eyes-100m-at-1-5b-valuation-with-ai-that-lets-anyone-build-apps/) to fuel its "vibe coding" platform. The 2-year-old startup has had crazy growth, hitting $1M in ARR just 8 days after launch. Then, it scaled to $61M ARR with only 28 employees (that's $1M+ per person). Typing to be the anti-Cursor, Lovable is betting big that the 99% of people who can't code represent a massive untapped market.
