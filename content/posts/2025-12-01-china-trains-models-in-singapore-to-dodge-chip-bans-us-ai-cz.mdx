## 🐉 The Chip Ban Backfire: China Does More With Less

[DeepSeek-V3.2: Pushing the Frontier of Open Large Language Models](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2/resolve/main/assets/paper.pdf)

### 🏝️ When U.S. Chips Are Banned, Book a Southeast Asian Vacation

[Alibaba and ByteDance are training their latest AI models in Southeast Asian data centers](https://www.ft.com/content/96fe9898-a3a4-4a33-be1d-da06bdb6cb2b) to access Nvidia's high-end GPUs: 

  * **Singapore Boom:** Local data center operators report surging demand from Chinese AI firms since April 

  * **Models in Exile:** Both Qwen and Doubao are being trained abroad, and they're topping global LLM benchmarks anyway 

  * **100B+ Tokens:** Alibaba's November 2025 Qwen-SEA-LION-v4 was enhanced with Southeast Asian language data, now ranking #1 on regional evaluations 




**Translation:** This move turns US export restrictions into a minor geographic inconvenience as US chip restrictions assume geography equals control. Since Trump's April 2025 embargo on H20 chips to China, Singapore and Malaysia have become the hottest destinations for Chinese AI training runs. 

**Reality Check:** Trying to contain Chinese AI development with export controls is like building a fence around one country's data centers, which is pointless when the entire region is wired with the same chips. The blockade didn't slow China's models down; it just spread the technology further and is accidentally turbocharging Southeast Asia's own AI ecosystem 

### 🥇 DeepSeek Drops Gold-Medal Models While Giving Away the Code

[DeepSeek just released two new reasoning models](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-01/deepseek-debuts-new-ai-models-to-rival-google-and-openai) claiming GPT-5 and Gemini-3.0-Pro parity and brought receipts: 

  * **DeepSeek-V3.2:** "GPT-5 level" for daily use, available on app, web, and API 

  * **V3.2-Speciale:** Achieved gold-medal performance in IMO, CMO, ICPC World Finals, and IOI 2025 

  * **85K+ Complex iInstructions:** Trained on 1,800+ environments for agent-specific tasks 




**The Math Capabilities:**[ DeepSeekMath-V2](https://the-decoder.com/deepseekmath-v2-is-deepseeks-latest-attempt-to-pop-the-us-ai-bubble/) solved 5/6 IMO 2025 problems as the first open-weight AI to hit the gold-medal tier. It scored 118/120 on Putnam 2024, demolishing the best human score of 90. The secret? A self-verifiable reasoning system that peer-reviews its own work before submitting. 

**Reality Check:** While Western labs obsess over billion-dollar compute deals, DeepSeek ships models that beat Ivy League students at advanced mathematics and gives them away for free under Apache 2.0. The "AI is a US monopoly" narrative is looking increasingly quaint. 

### 👁️ Alibaba Builds the Full Stack: From Vision Models to Smart Glasses

[Alibaba's Qwen3-VL](https://the-decoder.com/qwen3-vl-can-scan-two-hour-videos-and-pinpoint-nearly-every-detail/) is making OpenAI's flagship look myopic, beating both GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro on specialized vision benchmarks: 

  * **85.8% vs 81.3%:** Qwen3-VL's lead over GPT-5 on MathVista visual mathematics 

  * **100% Accuracy:** Perfect needle-in-a-haystack on 30-minute videos 

  * **39 Languages:** OCR text recognition, 4x predecessor coverage 




**Beyond the Models:** [The Quark S1 smart glasses](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-27/alibaba-releases-quark-smart-glasses-with-its-qwen-ai-built-in) launched for $537, which undercut Meta's $800 glasses by a third. Dual Micro LED displays overlay real-time Qwen-powered contextual information onto your vision. International versions are coming in 2026. 

**Translation:** Chinese tech giants aren't content building competitive models anymore; they're racing to own the entire stack, from silicon to hardware strapped to your skull. When an e-commerce company manufactures AI eyewear at mass-market prices, they're betting they can leapfrog Western hardware entirely. 

## 💔 ChatGPT Won The Battle, Lost The War

### ⏱️ Users Are Spending More Time With Gemini

[OpenAI is facing its most intense competitive pressure since ChatGPT's debut three years ago](https://www.ft.com/content/8881062d-ff4f-4454-8e9d-d992e8e2c4e3?accessToken=zwAGRMnu-vegkdOIgQYt_09EVNOOndmS6OLE4w.MEUCIC_ne2t1xC_wB03xTgc3tM0vdJzDrsRv4LICLFBcT_itAiEApmmEGxgLPIypQvvFx8LWH6pRPvbyc2HBwWHwng6_rmU&sharetype=gift&token=703783c7-8f6b-4e8e-bbdf-d9cb96441ca7): According to Similarweb, users are now chatting longer with Gemini than with either ChatGPT or Claude. In the attention economy, time is the only metric that matters, and OpenAI is losing it. 

**Beyond Parity:** When users choose to spend more time with a competitor, they're voting with the most finite resource they have. Google's deep integration with Search, Gmail, and Docs is doing exactly what it was designed to do: keep users in the Gemini ecosystem longer. 

**Reality Check:** ChatGPT popularized conversational AI, but popularization and dominance are different things. The first mover taught everyone how valuable this tech could be, but despite OpenAI spending three years building the market, its competitors are spending 2025 capturing it. 

### 🎣 Claude's Hook: 60% of Customers Can't Use Just One

[Anthropic says 60%+ of its business customers now use more than one Claude product](http://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2025/11/28/anthropic-enterprise-claude/), a sticky pattern the company started noticing in summer 2025 after Claude Code exploded in popularity. 

**Moving Beyond Chatbots:** When customers start with Claude for general tasks, then add Claude Code for development, then layer in API access for custom workflows, they're building dependencies across their entire tech stack. Each additional product makes switching to a competitor exponentially harder. 

**Translation:** While OpenAI has been focused on flashy model releases and hardware partnerships, Anthropic has been quietly building the product suite that makes leaving painful. It's the enterprise software playbook: get them on one product, expand to three, and suddenly migration costs become a board-level discussion. This multi-product stickiness is exactly what made Microsoft Office untouchable for decades. 

**Bottom Line:** OpenAI still has the brand recognition, but Anthropic is building something more dangerous: habit formation across multiple use cases. When your developers code in Claude, your analysts research in Claude, and your APIs call Claude, switching becomes a company-wide migration project, not a subscription cancellation. 

### 🇨🇳 American Startups Are Building on Chinese AI

[US startups are ditching OpenAI's premium APIs for free Chinese open-weight models](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/silicon-valley-building-free-chinese-ai-rcna242430), as roughly 80% of startup pitches now incorporate Chinese open-source model foundations, which is a stunning reversal from just 18 months ago. 

**Why Startups Are Switching:**

  * **$0 vs. $1000s:** Chinese models (Qwen, DeepSeek, etc.) are freely downloadable, eliminating the subscription and API costs bleeding startups dry 

  * **Performance Parity:** Alibaba's Qwen-2.5-Max now matches or exceeds GPT-4 on key benchmarks, destroying the "you get what you pay for" argument 

  * **Full Customization:** Open weights mean startups can fine-tune for specific use cases instead of begging OpenAI to adjust their black box 




**The Irony:** Sam Altman spent 2023 warning about Chinese AI dominance while pricing his own customers directly into Beijing's arms. OpenAI's moat was supposed to be capability leadership so overwhelming that price didn't matter. 

**Reality Check:** But when free Chinese models reach "good enough" for 80% of use cases, suddenly that $200/month ChatGPT Plus subscription funds a competitor ecosystem instead of customer loyalty. 

## 🧩 The Great Regulatory Fracture: Tech Rules Splinter Everywhere

[David Sacks on X: INSIDE NYT’S HOAX FACTORY](https://x.com/DavidSacks/status/1995225152674533557)

### 🤝 When the Fox Guards the AI Henhouse

[Trump's AI czar David Sacks is writing rules for industries where he holds 449 AI investments](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/technology/david-sacks-white-house-profits.html) out of the 708 total tech investments in his disclosed portfolio. The NYT investigation reveals regulatory capture in action: the guy dismantling AI restrictions profits from their removal. 

**The Brutal Math:**

  * **$1M Sponsorships:** What his All-In podcast sought at a White House AI summit 

  * **10x Mandate:** His goal to "cut 10 times more regulations than new ones"




Sacks received two ethics waivers and claims divestment, but filings don't specify when he sold or what remains. Senator Warren called it "explicit conflict of interest." Legal ethics expert Kathleen Clark: "graft." Sacks' response? "Nothing burger."

[Axios' Dan Primack argues](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-pro-rata-1d32bd61-9974-4088-adc9-11b8f668d324.html) these policies might genuinely help the US compete with China, even as they benefit Sacks' portfolio. Federal ethics rules permit this, which is the regulatory equivalent of grading your own homework. 

**Reality Check:** Whether Sacks is a conflicted insider or visionary patriot depends on whether deregulation works. If it backfires, he's the poster child for why the Valley shouldn't write its own rules.
