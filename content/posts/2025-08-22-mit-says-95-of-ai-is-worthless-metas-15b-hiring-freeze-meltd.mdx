This week, Silicon Valley discovered that burning money doesn't make you smart. It just makes you broke. 

From MIT researchers exposing AI's zero-return reality to Meta freezing hiring after offering someone $1.5B, the tech industry is speedrunning through the five stages of grief while North Korean hackers are literally sitting in your Zoom calls. 

###### **As we continue to build at**[Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/)**, we 've launched **[Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/)**with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter.**

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **AI 's 95% Failure Rate:** MIT study reveals almost nobody's making money on AI as Altman admits bubble, triggering Nasdaq's worst drop in weeks 

  * **Meta 's $1.5B Whiplash:** After reportedly offering one researcher $1.5B, Meta freezes AI hiring while getting investigated for letting chatbots flirt with kids 

  * **996 Colonizes Silicon Valley:** Chinese work schedule (9am-9pm-6 days) now appearing in AI startup contracts as entry-level jobs vanish 

  * **North Korea 's LinkedIn Army:** Elite hackers using AI to forge identities and infiltrate Fortune 500s, funneling paychecks to Pyongyang 

  * **The Zombie Startup Apocalypse:** Google, Meta, Microsoft keep gutting AI startups by poaching talent, leaving investors holding worthless shells 




## 💥 The Great AI Reality Check: When 95% Failure Meets "Irrational Exuberance"

### 📉 MIT Just Destroyed Everyone's Vibes (With Data)

The party's over, and MIT brought the receipts. [A new study from MIT researchers found that 95% of organizations are getting "zero return" from their generative AI investments](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/), triggering the sharpest Nasdaq selloff in three weeks. 

**The Brutal Numbers:**

  * **95% failure rate** : Most companies are seeing absolutely nothing from AI investments 

  * **Nasdaq dropped 1.4%** : Biggest decline in nearly three weeks 

  * **Nvidia fell 3.5%** , Oracle down 5.9%, Palantir cratered 10% 

  * **$200B+ in market cap** : Evaporated faster than SBF's reputation 




**The Altman Bombshell** : In a moment of stunning honesty,[ OpenAI's CEO channeled Alan Greenspan to warn of "irrational exuberance"](https://ts2.tech/en/sam-altmans-ai-bubble-warning-is-the-tech-frenzy-nearing-a-dangerous-peak/) in AI markets: 

  * Admitted some investors will "lose a lot of money"

  * Said this WHILE his employees are cashing out shares in a new round 

  * Basically called his own industry a bubble while taking the money 




**The DeepSeek Shadow** : Just months after China's DeepSeek rattled markets by building competitive AI with a fraction of the compute, investors are realizing the moat might be more like a puddle. 

### 💸 The Hidden Crisis: AI Costs Are Going UP, Not Down

While everyone promised AI would be "too cheap to meter,"[ the reality is that costs have completely plateaued while usage has exploded](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/cost-buying-ai-creeping-boosting-microsoft-sellers). 

**The Cost Trap:**

  * **Token prices** : Haven't moved in 6 months 

  * **Token usage** : Exploding as agents need 10-100x more compute 

  * **Microsoft Azure revenue** : Up 39% YoY from desperate AI customers 

  * **Intuit 's Azure bill**: Jumping from $20M to $30M this year alone 




**Developer Apocalypse:**

  * Cursor and Replit forced to abandon flat-rate pricing 

  * Top-tier users are burning through monthly credits in days 

  * Unit economics are completely underwater for most AI apps 

  * The "build on OpenAI" strategy looks like the new "build on Twitter API"




**Bottom Line** : What was pitched as a deflationary revolution is turning into a toll road where Microsoft and Nvidia are the only ones collecting. 

## 🤖 Meta's $1.5B Meltdown: From Infinite Money to Infinite Problems

Photo by [Adrià García Sarceda](https://unsplash.com/@leonidasph?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/a-woman-holding-a-video-game-controller-in-her-hand-O560d5Mnc04?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash)

### 💰 The $1.5 Billion Recruitment That Broke the Dam

Meta just executed the most expensive 180.[ After reportedly dangling $1.5B to poach a single AI researcher and routinely offering $100M+ packages](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-hiring-freeze-fda6b3c4), they've completely frozen AI hiring. 

**The Compensation Arms Race (Now Suspended):**

  * **$1.5B** : Reportedly offered to one researcher (who said no) 

  * **$100M+** : Became standard for senior AI talent 

  * **Stock dilution concerns** : Investors finally did the math 

  * **Hiring freeze** : Announced amid division-wide restructuring 




**The Restructuring Chaos:**

  * [AI division is being split into 4 separate groups](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/technology/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ai.html): Research, Superintelligence, Products, and Infrastructure & Hardware 

  * Focus on "superintelligence" despite Llama underperforming 

  * Considering abandoning open-source approach entirely 

  * Staff cuts expected as reorganization excuse kicks in 




### 👶 Meanwhile, Meta's Chatbots Are Getting Inappropriate With Kids

As if the timing couldn't be worse,[ Reuters obtained Meta's internal "GenAI Content Risk Standards," which showed their chatbots were allowed to have "sensual" conversations with minors](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-guidelines/). 

**The Disturbing Guidelines:**

  * Chatbots could comment on children's attractiveness 

  * "Sensual" chats permitted as long as not "overtly sexual"

  * Could help construct racist arguments if not "excessively dehumanizing"

  * Document approved by Meta's legal, policy, and "Chief Ethicist"




**The Fallout:**

  * Multiple senators are launching investigations 

  * Texas investigating Meta and [Character.AI](https://Character.AI) for "deceptive practices"

  * Meta is scrambling to revise policies after leak 

  * Andy Stone is confirming authenticity while promising changes 




**The Pattern** : Meta once again proves that "move fast and break things" becomes problematic when the "things" are child safety standards. 

## ⏰ 996: Silicon Valley's New Normal (Thanks, AI)

[GitHub - 996icu/](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU)[996.ICU](https://996.ICU)[: Repo for counting stars and contributing](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU)

### 🏢 When 9am-9pm, 6 Days a Week Becomes Table Stakes

[The Chinese "996" work schedule is officially colonizing Silicon Valley](https://view.mail.fortune.com/?qs=038be347454644a2d6ca17b22c9378321baf079c4cf839a508bbaa974183400a82d2eead6075739292e499fdd170a1aa2f53325b8b8f74029b727231dbc6ce253cf37da213eecd300beaa891b46d33e1), with AI startups now putting 72-hour work weeks directly into employment contracts. 

**The New Reality:**

  * **996 = 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week** : Now appearing in actual contracts 

  * **Entry-level massacre** : Junior roles vanishing as AI automates basics 

  * **Average age plummeting** : Only 20-somethings can sustain this insanity 

  * **" Work-life balance"**: Now a punchline in recruiting calls 




**Notable Capital 's Jen Holmstrom**: "Some AI companies are looking to include 996 clauses in employment contracts. The intent is that the founders want to convey the intensity of the environment."

**The Demographic Time Bomb** : This works when you're 23 and living on Soylent. Less sustainable when you're 35 with kids and a mortgage. But who needs senior talent when you have AI, right? 

### 🎯 The New Hiring Hunger Games: Entry-Level is Dead

[The entire startup hiring playbook just got torched](https://fortune.com/2025/08/15/the-new-rules-for-startup-hiring/), with founders stalking talent like sports scouts while entry-level roles go extinct. 

**The Brutal New Rules:**

  * **" Talent density over headcount"**: The new mantra killing junior roles 

  * **Always Be Recruiting** : If you're posting a job, "you're already late"

  * **The Dubai Chase** : CEOs literally flying globally to close hires 

  * **AI company alumni** : Seed funds will "write you a check on the spot"




**GV 's Rhys Hughes**: "It's a hiring free-for-all. If a founder says, 'I'm open to a rec,' I say, 'You should already know three to four people.'"

**Accel 's Paula Judge**: "Start texting candidates immediately. Act like you're working together. Show them what it's going to be."

**The Irony** : Companies demand 996 schedules while complaining about talent shortage, automate away junior roles while desperate for seniors, and offer record packages while wondering why nobody stays. 

## ⚡ Quick Hits: When Everything Is Fine

  * 🧟****[**The Zombie Startup Factory**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/how-ai-zombie-deals-work-meta-google.html)**:** Google, Meta, and Microsoft aren't just competing for talent; they're creating an entire ecosystem of walking-dead companies. And VCs are getting nothing in return. 

  * 🤖[ xAI's Grok Accidentally Doxxes Itself](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/crazy-conspiracist-and-unhinged-comedian-groks-ai-persona-prompts-exposed/)**:** Elon's chatbot leaked its internal prompts, revealing personas including "crazy conspiracist" and "unhinged comedian." Even AI is having an identity crisis in 2025. 

  * 🇰🇵[ North Korea's IT Army Inside Your Company](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/19/north-korea-it-worker-fraud-fortune-500)**:** Elite developers using AI to forge résumés and identities, embedding in Fortune 500s while funneling paychecks to Pyongyang. That new remote dev who never turns on their camera? Yeah, about that... 

  * **💻**[ AI Hackers Stealing Billions](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/08/19/how-ai-enhanced-hackers-are-stealing-billions)**:** Cybercriminals now use AI to write malware, deepfake voices, and automate attacks. The good news? Cybersecurity spending is through the roof. The bad news? So are successful breaches.

## 💭 Parting Thoughts

We've reached peak Silicon Valley absurdity: companies offering $1.5B to hire someone while MIT proves nobody's making money, North Korean spies are in your Slack while your AI chatbot flirts with teenagers, and everyone's working 996 schedules to build products that 95% of customers get zero value from. 

The AI revolution isn't being televised; it's being livestreamed by overworked engineers burning through VC money faster than token prices can rise, while the only winners are Microsoft and Nvidia collecting rent on the whole disaster.
