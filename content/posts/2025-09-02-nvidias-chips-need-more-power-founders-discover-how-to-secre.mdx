Welcome to the week where Nvidia's GPUs are literally too powerful for Earth's electrical grid to handle, and founders invented a new class of stock that lets them cash out while pretending they're still all-in. 

###### As we continue to build at [Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/), we've launched [Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/) with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter.

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **Nvidia 's Power Crisis:** New chips need 25 gigawatts by 2026, almost as much as the entire US grid added last year, with data centers sitting idle waiting for electricity 

  * **$162B Secondary Market Insanity:** Private share trading up 45% YoY, with AI startups trading at premiums while everyone else takes 27% haircuts 

  * **Founder Preferred Stock Scam:** 11% of startups now issue special shares, letting founders cash out without tanking employee option prices 

  * **Fusion 's $3B Fantasy:** Commonwealth Fusion raised $863M (total: $3B), promising commercial fusion by 2027, which has been "20 years away" since 1950 

  * **OpenAI 's India Escape:** Building a 1GW data center in India because America's grid literally can't handle more AI infrastructure 




## 🔌 The Great Power Crisis: When AI's Appetite Exceeds Earth's Grid

### ⚡ Nvidia's Power Problem: When Your Chips Are Too Much for the Grid

[The Economist just dropped a reality bomb](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/08/28/how-a-power-shortage-could-short-circuit-nvidias-rise): Nvidia's meteoric rise might get short-circuited by something as basic as electricity. 

  * **The Math of Doom:** Between Feb 2024-26, if half of Nvidia's chips stay in the US, they'll need **25GWs** of new power; almost as much as the entire US grid added last year. Each high-end GPU burns 700W, and last year's sales alone could power 1.3M homes. 

  * **The Bottleneck From Hell:** Data centers are sitting idle waiting for power connections, while utilities are basically saying, "LOL, good luck with that." Nvidia's selling chips faster than humanity can build power plants. 




**What This Means:** Nvidia's growth could flatline, not because of competition or innovation, but because we literally can't generate enough electricity. Imagine having the most advanced AI chips on Earth, but being unable to use them. 

### 🇮🇳 OpenAI Plans Massive India Data Center Because US Can't Handle More

[OpenAI is building a 1-gigawatt data center in India](https://www.bloomberg.com/2025/09/01/openai-india-datacenter-stargate/), part of its Stargate infrastructure program, which is apparently colonizing the entire planet with GPUs. 

  * **The Scale:** 1GW could power tens of thousands of AI chips, basically a small city's worth of electricity. India is now OpenAI's second-largest market, and with their new Digital Personal Data Protection Act, keeping data local is mandatory. 

  * **The Politics:** This aligns with India's $1.2B IndiaAI Mission, because every country needs its own AI strategy now. Sam Altman is visiting India in September to announce the details. 




**The Real Play:** While the US power grid creaks under AI's demands, OpenAI's betting on countries desperate for tech investment to provide the infrastructure, as Microsoft, SoftBank, and Oracle are backing Stargate globally. 

## 🔥 The $3B Fusion Dream & America's Nuclear Renaissance

### ⚡ Commonwealth Fusion Raises $863M Because Physics is Optional Now

[Commonwealth Fusion Systems has just raised $863M](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/) from a diverse group of investors, including Nvidia, Google, Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy, and a consortium of 12 Japanese companies. 

  * **The MIT Spin-Out 's Pitch:** They're building SPARC, a prototype reactor in suburban Boston that'll supposedly achieve "scientific breakeven" by 2027, where the reaction produces more energy than it takes to start. Then they'll build ARC, a commercial plant in Virginia that Google's already agreed to buy 200MW from. 

  * **The Reality Check:** CFS has now raised $3B total, more than any fusion startup, to build something that's been "20 years away" since the 1950s. CEO Bob Mumgaard admits ARC will cost "several billion more," and they don't even know where that money's coming from. 




**Why This Time Might Be Different:** Their tokamak design uses superconducting magnets that didn't exist a decade ago, and AI is supposedly accelerating R&D.; Plus, with data centers about to consume entire power grids, tech giants are desperate enough to bet on fusion actually working before 2050. 

### 🔬 Los Alamos Scientists Channel THOR to Make Fusion Less Impossible

[Government scientists at Los Alamos just had a Marvel moment](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/thor-fusion-energy-government-lab-discovery/), achieving fusion ignition using something called THOR (Thinned Hohlraum Optimization for Radflow). 

  * **What They Actually Did:** Created special "windows" in the gold-coated cylinders that hold fusion fuel, letting X-rays escape so they can better observe how materials react to plasma conditions. They pulled it off in less than a year, which in government lab time is basically light speed. 

  * **The Awkward Part:** The press release casually mentions this tech is also valuable for "weapons development," because nothing says clean energy future like also advancing nuclear arsenals. 




### 💰 DOE Throws $35M at National Labs to Make Energy Great Again

[The Department of Energy is spreading $35M](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/09/02/doe-announces-35m-for-energy-tech-projects-at-national-labs-00536807) across national labs for everything from new nuclear reactors to wind farms. 

  * **The Strategy:** Use the Technology Commercialization Fund to turn lab innovations into actual products before China beats us to it. Projects span nuclear, wind, and "possibly wave energy" (because why not harness the ocean while we're at it). 

  * **The Timeline:** Achieve carbon-free electricity by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2050, which requires either breakthrough physics or time travel, but at least we're funding both. 




## 💸 The Weird New Market Where Founders Cash Out While You Can't

### 📈 Secondary Markets Hit $162B as Everyone Pretends Startups Are Liquid

[The secondary market for startup shares exploded to $162B in 2024](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/08/28/the-market-for-startup-shares-is-getting-even-weirder), up 45% YoY, creating a bizarre parallel universe where private companies trade like public ones except nobody knows the real price. 

  * **The New Reality:** AI startups and "$100B+ Private Mag 7" companies are trading at premiums (OpenAI or Anthropic will get above last-round valuations). However, if you're a Series B SaaS company, good luck getting 70 cents on the dollar. 

  * **The Stratification:** Elite AI startups have buyers lined up around the block, while 90% of companies can't find liquidity at any price. Private markets are projected to hit $62T by 2034, growing twice as fast as public markets. 




**What 's Actually Happening:** Institutional investors are piling into private markets because public markets are "too volatile," which is hilarious given private valuations are literally made up. Meanwhile, retail investors are getting "access" through platforms that let them buy tiny slices at inflated prices with zero liquidity. 

### 🎩 Founder Preferred Stock: The New Way to Have Your Cake and Sell It Too

[Nearly 11% of startups now issue "founder preferred" stock](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/founder-perk-showing-vc-deals), double from two years ago, because founders discovered they can sell shares without looking like they're abandoning ship. 

  * **The Magic Trick:** These "Series FF" shares (named after Founders Fund who popularized them) act like common stock in founders' hands but convert to preferred when sold. This lets founders cash out without spiking the 409A valuation that determines employee option prices. 

  * **Who 's Doing It:** Perplexity, Mercor, Skild AI, and basically every hot AI startup where founders have leverage. Stripe and Anduril pioneered it, and now it's spreading like a virus through companies with repeat founders who know the game. 

  * **The Controversy:** Some VCs hate it because it signals founders want early liquidity. One Fenwick & West lawyer said a VC recently refused to invest unless the startup killed its founder preferred stock. Meanwhile, employees receive another layer of preferred stock ahead of them in the event of liquidation. 




**The Real Tell:** When 11% of startups are structuring special shares so founders can sell early, you know everyone's thinking about exits before they've even found product-market fit. 

## ⚡ Startup Quick Hits: From Vibe Coding Apps to $100M+ Raises

[Lenny's Podcast - Everyone’s an engineer now | Guillermo Rauch, CEO of Vercel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QsTmu2CqhA)

🚀****[Vercel Triples to $9B Because Startups Need Infrastructure](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-27/vercel-triples-valuation-to-9-billion-with-accel-investment)**:** The web infrastructure darling has just raised $400M, led by Accel, at a $9B valuation, nearly tripling from its $3B tag just last year. With every AI startup needing deployment infrastructure, Vercel's Next.js framework has become the default choice for devs who'd rather ship than manage servers. 

🎨****[Framer Hits $2B Valuation For Websites Done For You](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-28/figma-rival-framer-raises-venture-capital-funding-at-2-billion-valuation)**:** The Dutch no-code website builder raised $100M Series D from Meritech and Atomico. With enterprise customers now driving most sign-ups (including Miro, Perplexity, and Scale AI), Framer's betting that the future of web design is dragging and dropping, not debugging JavaScript. 

🗾****[LayerX Scores $100M to Fix Japan's Office Worker Crisis](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/layerx-uses-ai-to-cut-enterprise-back-office-workload-scores-100m-in-series-b/)**:** The Japanese AI SaaS startup raised $100M Series B led by TCV, tackling the brutal reality that only 16% of digital transformations succeed. With Japan facing aging demographics and labor shortages, LayerX is automating finance, tax, and HR tasks for enterprises still drowning in paperwork. 

**💰**[33 AI Startups Have Raised $100M+ in 2025](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/here-are-the-33-us-ai-startups-that-have-raised-100m-or-more-in-2025/)**:** We're not even through Q3, and already 33 US AI companies have hauled in mega-rounds, with multiple billion-dollar raises and several companies double-dipping for seconds. Last year's 49 mega-rounds now look quaint as 2025 is on pace to shatter that record. 

## ⚡ VC Quick Hits: From Drug Manufacturing to Women’s Health

[Offcall Podcast - Mark Cuban: How I’d Reform Healthcare If I Were in Charge](https://www.offcall.com/learn/podcast/mark-cuban-interview-how-shark-tank-star-and-cost-plus-drugs-ceo-would-fix-healthcare)

💊****[Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs: Fighting America's $5T Healthcare Racket](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/mark-cubans-war-on-americas-5-trillion-healthcare-machine-they-cant-react-as-quickly/)**:** The billionaire maverick is waging war on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) by selling drugs at actual cost plus 15%, turning $1000 chemotherapy meds into $21 purchases. Cuban's building his own robotics-driven factory in Dallas that can switch drug production in four hours, solving those "convenient" shortages that mysteriously jack up prices. 

🔄****[Lakestar Raises $265M to Hold Winners Hostage Longer](https://techfundingnews.com/lakestar-265m-continuation-fund-european-vc/)**:** The European VC behind Spotify and Revolut just closed a $265M continuation fund, essentially moving portfolio companies from one pocket to another so they don't have to exit in this garbage IPO market. Led by secondary specialist Lexington Partners, this lets Lakestar keep milking their winners while giving LPs who want out a graceful exit (at a discount, naturally). 

🩺****[Portfolia Bets $20M That Women's Health Isn't Just a Niche](https://www.axios.com/pro/health-tech-deals/2025/08/27/portfolia-20m-fund-womens-health)**:** Trish Costello's Portfolia just launched a $20M fund for women's health startups, targeting the $48B market opportunity that male VCs somehow keep missing. Despite record funding in 2024, women's health companies still can't find exits or growth capital, shocking that an industry run by dudes in Patagonia vests doesn't prioritize menopause innovation.
