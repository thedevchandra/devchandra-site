This week, AI companies proved they can raise billions, launch groundbreaking products, and create PR disasters all at the same time. 

From $300/month chatbots quoting Hitler to browser wars heating up, it's been a masterclass in how fast-moving tech can go spectacularly wrong, and right. 

###### As we continue to build at [Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/), we've launched [Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/) with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter.

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **The $300 Disaster:** xAI launched the most expensive AI subscription ever ($300/month) just hours after its chatbot started quoting Hitler and its CEO "resigned."

  * **The Browser Wars Begin:** Three companies are racing to beat Google Chrome with AI-powered browsers that cost $200+ per month. 

  * **The Vibe Coding Gold Rush:** Microsoft just partnered with Replit while Bolt wrapped up a 100,000-person hackathon. No-code tools keep wowing! 

  * **Meta 's Culture Crisis:** Departing AI researcher called Meta's GenAI division "metastatic cancer" in a viral internal memo. 

  * **The AI Money Singularity:** $91B in Q2 venture funding, with 45% going to AI companies and two record-breaking rounds in 2025 alone. 




## 🎭 On This Week's Episode of "AI Goes Rogue"

Grok 4’s Performance on Several Benchmarks

## 🚀 Grok 4 Launches With a $300 Price Tag and a PR Crisis

[Elon Musk's xAI dropped Grok 4 this week](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/elon-musks-xai-launches-grok-4-alongside-a-300-monthly-subscription/?utm_campaign=social&utm_source=X&utm_medium=organic&_bhlid=9b1dacaadfce42a591347bf86ab104dafeec563f): 

  * **The Numbers that Matter** : Elon claimed it beats OpenAI and Google on key benchmarks: 

    * **Humanity 's Last Exam** (crowdsourced Q&A; on math, science, humanities): 

      * Grok 4: 25.4% vs Gemini 2.5 Pro (21.6%) and OpenAI o3 (21%) 

      * Grok 4 Heavy with tools: 44.4% vs Gemini with tools (26.9%) 

    * **ARC-AGI-2** (visual pattern recognition puzzles): Grok hit 16.2%, nearly 2x better than Claude Opus 4. 

  * **There’s One Problem** : Hours before the launch, Grok's X account went full antisemitic meltdown, posting Hitler praise and attacking Jewish figures before xAI yanked it offline. 

  * **$300 “SuperGrok” Pricing** : The company also launched "SuperGrok Heavy" at $300 per month, making it the priciest AI subscription on the market. 




This is a masterclass in how _not_ to launch enterprise AI. While Grok 4's performance looks impressive, the timing couldn't be worse. Enterprise buyers, especially in the cautious post-ChatGPT era, want reliability and safety guardrails, not whatever this is. 

### 🚪 X's CEO Linda Yaccarino Steps Down (Worst Timing Ever?)

[Linda Yaccarino officially stepped down as X's CEO](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/linda-yaccarino-steps-down-as-ceo-of-elon-musks-x/?_bhlid=d2d7bf92aebcc21a2c6966b73ba4b8552a906922) on Wednesday, just one day after Grok's antisemitic meltdown forced xAI to yank the chatbot offline. 

  * **Coincidence? Maybe** : But after two years of trying to rebuild advertiser relationships while Elon Musk torpedoed them on the same platform, her exit feels more like inevitability than surprise. 

  * **The Impossible Job:** Yaccarino was hired to do one thing: bring back the advertisers who fled after Musk's takeover. Instead, she spent 24 months playing damage control while Musk told boycotting advertisers to "go f*** yourself" in public interviews. 




Yaccarino's exit caps off a brutal week for Musk's empire. First, Grok goes rogue, now his hand-picked CEO walks. This is a textbook case of how founder ego can torpedo even the best-laid business plans. 

## 🌐 The AI Browser Wars Heat Up

Join the Waitlist: [Comet by Perplexity](https://comet.perplexity.ai/)

The browser market is getting its biggest shake-up since Chrome launched in 2008: 

### ☄️ Perplexity's Comet Browser

[Perplexity just released an AI-powered browser with built-in "Comet Assistant"](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/?utm_source=grant.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=meta-s-cancer-culture&_bhlid=1735528c5f4a9c1cd7571c2cda60e193fec871ed) that can summarize emails, manage tabs, and book travel. 

  * **The Reality Check** : Early tests show it handles simple tasks well but struggles with complex requests (like booking airport parking with correct dates). 

  * **Pricing** : $200/month for Max plan subscribers only. 




### 🌀 Arc's Dramatic Pivot to Dia

[The Browser Company is potentially selling or open-sourcing Arc](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/the-browser-company-mulls-selling-or-open-sourcing-arc-browser-amid-ai-focused-pivot/) to focus on "Dia," their new AI-native browser. 

  * **The Admission** : Arc's team acknowledged that their beloved browser had become "too complex for many users."

  * **The Strategy** : Dia aims for broader appeal with AI woven into core browsing, not bolted on top. 




### 🤫 OpenAI's Secret Project

[OpenAI is also building an AI-native browser](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/openai-release-web-browser-challenge-google-chrome-2025-07-09/?utm_source=grant.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=meta-s-cancer-culture&_bhlid=5566ec63c1db69a4f56bd4a9aed8fbbfaceab90c) with GPT-4o embedded in every tab. 

  * **The Team** : They’re poaching ex-Chrome engineers for the project. 

  * **The Timeline** : No official launch date, but development is reportedly moving fast. 




These companies are betting that AI agent will own the entire browsing experience, not just live in a sidebar. Whichever company wins will have the power to control how over 5 billion people interact with the internet daily. 

## 💻 The Vibe Coding Wars

Joe Rogan Experience [#2344 - Amjad Masad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfmrEa0L08E)

### 🤝 Replit's Microsoft Partnership

Just fresh off a Joe Rogan interview, CEO Amjad Masad revealed Replit went from $10M to $100M ARR in just six months, with over 500,000 users on the platform. 

Now, [Replit just inked a major partnership with Microsoft Azure](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/in-a-blow-to-google-cloud-replit-partners-with-microsoft/?utm_source=grant.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=apple-s-leadership-shakeup&_bhlid=f46ecbd8ce9e80264e29da437043dd2040831927), bringing its no-code/low-code tools to enterprise customers: 

  * **Azure Marketplace Integration** : Microsoft shops can now purchase Replit subscriptions directly through Azure's enterprise store. 

  * **Cloud Services Integration** : Replit apps will run on Azure containers, VMs, and Microsoft's Postgres database, generating Azure revenue. 

  * **Strategic Positioning** : While Microsoft has GitHub Copilot for programmers, Replit targets the 99% of office workers who want to build apps without coding knowledge. 




The Microsoft partnership is a symbolic blow to Google Cloud, where Replit-hosted apps have traditionally lived. 

### 🏆 Bolt's Million-Dollar Hackathon

Bolt just wrapped the ["World's Largest Hackathon"](https://hackathon.dev/) with 100,000 participants and $1M+ in prizes. And they're submitting it to Guinness World Records! 

  * **Community-Driven Strategy** : The hackathon perfectly exemplifies Bolt's core growth loop: get people to build apps, then share what they made. 

  * **Rapid Scale** : The company went from near-death at $0.7M ARR to $40M ARR in just five months after launching their AI app builder 

  * **Meta Marketing** : They used [Bolt.new](https://Bolt.new) to build the hackathon registration site itself, showcasing the product's capabilities 




While Replit courts the enterprise market, Bolt is betting on the developer community and viral growth. The hackathon generated massive social proof and created an army of 100,000 developers who now have skin in the game. 

## ⚡ Quick Hits

💀**Meta 's "Metastatic Cancer" Problem: **A departing AI researcher who worked on Meta's Llama models called the company's GenAI division "metastatic cancer" in a viral internal memo, citing "culture of fear" and mission confusion. Despite nine-figure compensation packages, Meta keeps hemorrhaging top AI talent who apparently prefer writing scathing exit memos to staying. 

📡**Jack Dorsey 's Weekend Project:** [Built "Bitchat," a Bluetooth mesh messaging app](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/jack-dorsey-working-on-bluetooth-messaging-app-bitchat/) that works without internet up to 300 meters. The 10,000-user beta filled instantly, as apparently people really want off-grid communication options. 

**💰 AI Funding Keeps Going Nuclear:** [Q2 venture funding hit $91B with 45% going to AI](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-funding-climbs-q2-2025-ai-ma-data/). Scale AI ($14.3B) and OpenAI ($40B) set the two largest funding records in history. Just 11 companies captured $70B - one-third of all venture capital.
