## 🎯 Nvidia's Strategic Pivot: From Cloud Competitor to Internal Powerhouse

[NVIDIA H200 GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h200/)

### 💨 DGX Cloud Folds Into Engineering as Nvidia Abandons AWS Fight

[Nvidia is merging its DGX Cloud group into its core engineering organization](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nvidia-restructures-cloud-team-retreating-aws-competition), effectively abandoning its push to compete with AWS and other hyperscalers as a stand-alone enterprise cloud provider. The platform will now focus on powering Nvidia's own AI model and chip R&D.;

**The Numbers:**

  * **The Pivot:** From selling cloud to enterprises → internal AI development platform 

  * **The Signal:** Even Nvidia can't fight the hyperscaler wars while running an AI chip monopoly 

  * **The Strategy:** Focus the compute on making better chips rather than reselling them 




**Translation:** When the company that makes 90% of AI training chips decides it can't compete in cloud, it tells you everything about hyperscaler moat depth. Nvidia's betting its future on silicon, not services. 

### 🇨🇳 H200 Shipments Resume to China While Workarounds Multiply

[Nvidia plans to resume H200 exports to China before mid-February 2026](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-aims-begin-h200-chip-shipments-china-by-mid-february-sources-say-2025-12-22/), with initial shipments expected to range from 40K to 80K units. The H200 is Nvidia's second-most powerful AI chip, and the move comes after a pause under earlier export controls. 

**The Loophole Economy:**[ Tokyo-based Datasection signed a $1.2B+ contract giving Tencent access to 15,000 Blackwell chips](https://www.ft.com/content/9b47c335-9633-4560-9f57-5736c9d04bef) through Japanese cloud data centers. Chinese companies can't buy the chips directly, so they're renting them through offshore "compute proxies."

**The Policy Contradiction:**[ A Council on Foreign Relations analysis shows the H200 is more than six times more powerful](https://www.cfr.org/article/chinas-ai-chip-deficit-why-huawei-cant-catch-nvidia-and-us-export-controls-should-remain) than any previously approved chip for China, and better than anything Huawei plans to make for at least two years. The rationale that Huawei is a "viable competitor," justifying looser controls, doesn't hold up to the data. 

**Reality Check:** US export policy is simultaneously blocking direct sales while approving workarounds that achieve the same result at a higher cost. China's getting the chips either way; the only question is whether American companies or Japanese intermediaries capture the margin. 

## 🔬 China's Semiconductor Manhattan Project: Reverse-Engineering the Future

Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography machine

### ⚛️ China Builds Working EUV Prototype with Ex-ASML Engineers

[Chinese scientists in Shenzhen have developed the nation's first Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography machine](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-china-built-its-manhattan-project-rival-west-ai-chips-2025-12-17/), a highly complex piece of equipment required to produce state-of-the-art AI chips. The massive machine, occupying an entire factory floor, was reportedly reverse-engineered using ASML's technology with assistance from former ASML employees. 

**The Status:**

  * **Operational:** The prototype works but isn't yet producing chips at scale 

  * **The Gap:** Technical challenges remain before commercial production 

  * **The Timeline:** Years behind ASML, but accelerating 




**The DUV Retrofit:**[ China is also retrofitting older ASML DUV machines](https://www.ft.com/content/d10398db-b8b4-40f3-8c6d-b340470f5f3c) to produce advanced smartphone and AI chips, exposing cracks in US-led export controls. When you can't buy the latest equipment, you squeeze more out of what you have. 

**Translation:** Export controls were designed to keep China a decade behind in semiconductor manufacturing. China's response has been to throw unlimited resources at the problem, recruit talent from Western companies, and treat the gap as an engineering challenge rather than an insurmountable barrier. The controls are working, just not as well as advertised. 

## 🔍 Google's Compute Crunch: When You Can't Get Enough Chips

### 🏛️ Executive Council Forms to Ration AI Compute

[Google has formed a small internal executive council to ration and allocate AI computing capacity](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-balancing-act-googles-compute-crunch) because demand for chips and data center resources is outpacing supply, even after massive capex increases. Thomas Kurian (Cloud CEO) and Demis Hassabis (DeepMind CEO) are among the key members. 

**The Tension:** Cloud revenue demands GPUs for paying customers. Core products need compute for Search and YouTube AI features. DeepMind needs capacity for frontier research. Everyone's fighting over the same silicon. 

### 🏗️ Alphabet Buys Intersect for $4.75B to Build Faster

[Alphabet agreed to acquire data center company Intersect for $4.75B in cash](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-22/alphabet-to-buy-data-center-partner-intersect-for-4-75-billion), plus existing debt. Intersect pairs data centers with on-site power generation, exactly what Google needs to accelerate its AI infrastructure buildout. 

**The Context:** Google had previously partnered with Intersect in a multi-party deal announced in late 2024. When a partnership isn't fast enough, you buy the whole company. 

### 🧮 The Innovator's Dilemma Hits Mountain View

[Analysis from SiliconANGLE argues that Google faces the ultimate innovator's dilemma](https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/21/nvidia-maintains-moat-gemini-wont-kill-openai/) because its search business is tightly linked to advertising revenue. Moving to a chatbot-like experience increases cost to serve by 100x. The alternative, shifting toward integrated shopping, requires a trust relationship with users that Google doesn't currently possess. 

**The Bright Spot:** Josh Woodward, head of Google Labs,[ is credited with driving Gemini app growth from 350M to 650M MAUs in 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/20/josh-woodward-google-gemini-ai-safety.html). Consumer AI isn't hopeless; it's just expensive. 

**Reality Check:** The company that invented the Transformer architecture is now rationing compute while buying data centers at premium prices. Google's not losing the AI race, but it's definitely not winning it either. 

## 📱 TikTok's $45B American Makeover Finally Closes

TikTok's long-awaited US sale[ will formally close on January 22, 2026](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/18/tiktok-sale). An investor group including Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX will take a 45% stake in the new entity. 

**The Ownership Structure:**

  * **45%:** Oracle, Silver Lake, MGX (new investor consortium) 

  * **30%:** ByteDance's existing investors 

  * **20%:** ByteDance itself 

  * **5%:** Still-unnamed investors 




**The Fine Print:**[ According to an internal memo](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/18/tiktok-sale), TikTok's global business will still handle ecommerce, advertising, and marketing. The algorithm gets retrained on US user data. Oracle oversees data protection. 

**Translation:** ByteDance keeps 20% direct ownership plus influence through its existing investors' 30% stake. The "divestiture" looks more like a financial restructuring than a clean break. The algorithm that Washington claimed was a national security threat will be retrained, not replaced. 

## 🤖 AI Models & Research: The Year in Review

[Karpathy: 2025 LLM Year in Review](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/year-in-review-2025/)

### 📊 Karpathy's 2025 Verdict: RLVR Is the New Scaling

Andrej Karpathy's[ 2025 "LLM Year in Review"](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/year-in-review-2025/) frames this year as a transition from scaling-only progress to optimization-driven progress, with RLVR (Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards) as the central mechanism. 

**The Shift:** Instead of learning from subjective human-preference labels, models are trained in environments with automatically verifiable rewards, math puzzles, code, and logic tasks, where outputs are either correct or incorrect. This enables much longer RL runs than typical RLHF, as the reward signal is cheap, automated, and consistent. 

**The Jagged Intelligence Problem:** Karpathy describes current systems as "summoned ghosts" rather than growing animals. Intelligence under RLVR becomes extremely spiked: brilliant on tasks resembling training environments, unreliable everywhere else. Benchmarks become optimization targets rather than intelligence measures. 

**The GUI Future:** Karpathy singles out Google's "Nano Banana" as a paradigm-shifting example, not for image quality, but for hinting at an LLM-native GUI layer where text, image generation, and world knowledge share the same weights. Today's chat interfaces are the command lines of AI; tomorrow's will be interactive canvases. 

### 🔍 OpenAI's Monitorability Framework

[OpenAI released a framework for evaluating chain-of-thought monitorability](https://openai.com/index/evaluating-chain-of-thought-monitorability/), assessing whether a model's verbalized reasoning reliably reflects its internal decision-making, particularly for safety-relevant behaviors such as deception or reward hacking. The 13-evaluation suite across 24 environments aims to make CoT a scalable safety control mechanism.

### 💭 Parting Thoughts

So there you have it: a week where Nvidia retreated from cloud wars to focus on what it does best, China reverse-engineered the most complex manufacturing equipment on Earth with help from the company that built it, and Google formed an executive council to decide which of its own divisions gets to use its own chips. 

The theme of 2025 might be this: every company is either building AI infrastructure, buying AI infrastructure, or routing around export controls to access AI infrastructure. The rest is just commentary.
