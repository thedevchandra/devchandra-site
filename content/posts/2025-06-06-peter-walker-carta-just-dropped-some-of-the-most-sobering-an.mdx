Let's dive deeper into what is trending this past week in startups! 

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **Peter Walker’s AI Fundraising Trends** : ARR per FTE is the hot metric, bridge rounds and “seedstrapping” are on the rise, and AI deal sizes are surging despite less deals overall. 

  * **Perplexity Labs Launch** : Turn ideas into reports, dashboards, or mini apps in minutes, perfect for prototyping pitch decks or automating deep research. 

  * **Claude 4 is Out** : Claude Opus 4 is crushing the industry-leading SWE-benchmarks, while Sonnet 4 is perfect for everyday tasks. 

  * **AI-Driven Job Loss Warning** : Anthropic’s CEO warns AI could replace 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within 5 years, with tech layoffs already topping 62,000 in 2025. 

  * **SF Office Revival from AI Boom** : AI startups are reversing SF’s office slump, leasing millions of square feet and potentially halving vacancy rates by 2030. 

  * **Sus State AI Usage Report** : The California gov claims zero “high-risk” AI use across 200+ state agencies, which is questionable given the state’s history. 




## 🔍 Sobering Insights from Peter Walker on AI Fundraising Trends

Last Thursday, I attended an incredible talk by [Peter Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterjameswalker), Head of Insights at Carta, at Inception Studio. Peter delved into the latest trends in fundraising and AI: 

### 📉 What Do Funding Rounds Look Like?

  * **Decline in Seed-to-Series A graduation** : Only 15.4% of companies that raised a Seed round in Q1 2022 advanced to Series A within two years, down from 30.6% for the Q1 2018 cohort. Competition is tighter, and investors are far more selective.

  * **Extended funding timelines** : Fundraising timelines are getting longer as the typical 18-24 month cadence is breaking down. Some founders aren’t raising again cause they can’t. Others aren't, because they don’t need to. 

  * **Prevalence of bridge rounds** : In Q1 2024, 42% of seed-stage investments were bridge or extension rounds, marking the highest percentage in over a decade. Startups are trying to buy time. 

  * **Emergence of ‘seedstrapping’** : Founders are increasingly raising modest initial rounds ($1-$5M), aiming for profitability and scalability without more funding, a trend known as ‘seedstrapping.’ 




### 🚀 How Does AI Fit In?

  * **AI investment surge** : Global AI startup funding reached $100 billion in 2024, an 80% increase from the previous year. “AI isn’t a category. It’s a theme that cuts through every sector.” 

  * **Fewer deals, higher valuations in AI** : The average AI deal size in 2024 increased to $28.9 million, up 55% from $18.6 million in 2023. If investors want you, they’ll pay, but they’re funding fewer startups overall.

  * **SF still dominates AI venture capital** : The Bay Area pulls in 50% of early-stage AI funding and 75% of late-stage AI capital. If you’re raising in AI, this is still the place to be.

  * **Reduced hiring in startups** : Seed-funded startups averaged 5.3 employees in H1 2024, down from 6.9 three years prior. Startups are delaying making that first hire as AI tools are now doing what used to require full teams.




### 🌱 How Are Startups Built Today?

  * **Teams are leaner across the board** : In 2022, Series A startups had around 22 employees. In 2024, it’s down to 15. For AI startups, just 12. Small, fast, and capital-efficient is the new standard.

  * **ARR per FTE is the new investor metric** : Know it! It is revenue generated per full-time employee (FTE). Efficiency now, more than ever, is how well you leverage both capital and AI.

  * **Option pools are shrinking** : Founders are reserving less equity for hiring, with 6-8% instead of the typical 10-20%, because they don’t need as many people. Or any yet.




Fewer startup winners are raising, but they’re raising bigger as valuations are way up. But only a narrow slice of startups are getting funded. If you get into that group, the upside seems way larger.

## 🧠 Major AI Drops: Perplexity Labs & Claude 4

### 🧪 Perplexity Labs: Your AI Project Partner

Perplexity AI has launched [**Perplexity Labs**](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-labs) , a powerful tool for Pro subscribers that takes ideas and turns them into comprehensive reports, dashboards, and even mini web apps. It can do in-depth research and analysis in about 10 minutes! 

✅**** Try it out to rapidly prototype investor pitch decks, automate market research reports, or develop interactive dashboards for your startup! 

### 🤖 Claude 4: Your Full-Time Coding Teammate

Anthropic’s [**Claude Opus 4**](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4) has set a new benchmark by autonomously coding for over 7 hours, achieving a 72.5% score on the SWE-bench, surpassing GPT-4.1’s 54.6%. They also introduced [**Claude Code**](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) to give you AI across the entire product development cycle. 

✅**** Use **Sonnet 4** for everyday work, such as emails and summarizing, while deploying **Opus 4** for deep work, such as code refactoring or in-depth analysis. 

## 🌉 California at the Crossroads: AI, Jobs, and Real Estate

### ⚠️ Anthropic CEO Warns of AI-Driven Job Displacement

Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, [stated that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs](https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-ceo-warning-ai-could-eliminate-jobs-2025-5) within the next five years, potentially leading to unemployment rates exceeding 10%. Already in 2025, over 62,000 employees have been laid off across tech, including at Google, Microsoft, and Intel. 

### 🏢 AI Startups Revitalize San Francisco’s Office Market

Previously struggling with high vacancy rates, [SF’s office market is experiencing a resurgence](https://www.globest.com/2025/05/27/ai-companies-on-track-to-lease-27m-square-feet-annually-in-san-francisco/) driven by AI. In the past five years, AI tech companies have leased more than 5M square feet of office space in the city. They are projected to occupy up to 16M square feet by 2030, which would drop the city’s vacancy rate from 35.8% to 16%. 

### 🕵️ California Reports No High-Risk AI Use in Government Agencies

A recent report from the California DoT states that nearly 200 state agencies reported no use of high-risk AI and algorithms in their systems. This [finding is a little suspect and probably underestimates](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/05/california-somehow-finds-no-ai-risks/) the use of AI in the state gov, given the state’s history of using it in unemployment and criminal justice.
