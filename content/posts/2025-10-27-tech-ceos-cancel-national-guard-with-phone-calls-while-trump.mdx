## 🌉 When Tech CEOs Speed-Dial Trump: San Francisco's National Guard Crisis Averted

Molnar](https://unsplash.com/@jamesamolnar?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on[ Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/a-bridge-over-a-body-of-water-with-a-city-in-the-background-bBdiNBZyFfg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)

In the most Silicon Valley resolution possible, Trump called off a planned National Guard "surge" into SF after [Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Salesforce's Marc Benioff called him directly](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/trump-san-francisco-national-guard-huang-benioff.html). 

"Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great," Trump posted on Truth Social Thursday, announcing he was backing off federal deployment after speaking with Mayor Daniel Lurie. 

**The Whiplash Timeline** : Benioff initially told the NYT he'd support Trump's call for federal troops, earning public backing from Elon Musk and David Sacks. Then, facing massive criticism, he backtracked on Friday, saying "I do not believe the National Guard is needed" after "the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history."

**The Data that Saved SF:** Crime down 30% from 2024, homicides at 70-year lows, car break-ins at 22-year lows. Meanwhile, venture funding in 2025 is expected to surpass 2021's record, driven entirely by AI. 

**Translation:** When your city's biggest tech CEOs have the president's cell phone number and your crime stats actually back up your claims, you can negotiate military deployment like it's a B2B SaaS contract. Mayor Lurie's strategy of not publicly attacking Trump, unlike Pelosi's and Newsom's, apparently works better than feuding on Twitter. 

## 🏛️ Crypto's Institutional Legitimacy Play: From Revolution to Suit-and-Tie

[Trump on Binance's Changpeng Zhao pardon: ‘People say that he wasn't guilty’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oJA8kcnBb4)

### 🎰 Trump Pardons CZ After Binance Founder Spent Months Boosting Trump Family's Crypto Venture

[On October 23, President Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao (CZ)](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/24/nx-s1-5583983/trump-pardons-jailed-binance-founder-who-supported-trump-family-crypto-business), Binance's founder, clearing his criminal record from a 2024 conviction for violating the Bank Secrecy Act. 

**The Timeline** : CZ pleaded guilty in November 2023, paid $4.3B in fines, served four months in prison, then spent months boosting Trump's World Liberty Financial crypto venture. Presidential pardon delivered October 2025. 

**The Framing** : White House claims they're pushing back against the Biden admin's "war on cryptocurrency." However, it seems that CZ helped the Trump family's crypto business, and the Trump admin “transactionally” cleared his record. 

**Other Moves** : [Trump also nominated Michael Selig](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/25/trump-mike-selig-cftc-00621525), currently chief counsel for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) crypto task force, to run the entire agency. What a victory for an industry that spent big on lobbying to get the friendlier regulator (CFTC) over the SEC. 

**Reality Check:** [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) now holds 0.75% market share, down from dominance. The pardon doesn't fix that, but shows that for crypto, regulatory consequences expire if you know the right people. 

### 💰 Stablecoins: The $15B Profit Machine Running on $10B Monthly Volume

[The GENIUS Act legalized payment stablecoins in July 2025, and monthly transaction volume has doubled](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stablecoin-payments-hit-record-real-072349011.html). Artemis reports $10B+ in stablecoin transactions in August, up from $6B in February. This is real payment infrastructure scaling faster than traditional cross-border rails. 

Second,[ Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino projects $15B profit in 2025](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-24/stablecoin-leader-tether-expects-profit-to-increase-to-15-billion-this-year), up from $13B in 2024. That's more profit than Stripe, approaching Visa levels, from supposedly just holding $1 in reserves for every $1 of stablecoin. 

**The Paradox:** Legitimate stablecoin adoption explodes under regulation (the GENIUS Act mandates reserves, audits, and consumer protections) while Tether, still largely unregulated, prints $15B by investing your deposits in Treasury bills and keeping 100% of the returns. 

**The Irony:** Crypto maximalists spent a decade arguing that regulation would destroy innovation. The second Congress legalized stablecoins with actual oversight, and usage exploded. Meanwhile, unregulated players prints more profit than most banks. 

### 🏦 Crypto Exchanges Become Banks While Traditional Banks Become Crypto Infrastructure

**Crypto Exchanges** : [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com)[ just applied for a National Trust Bank Charter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-24/crypto-com-joins-digital-asset-firms-pursuing-us-bank-charters), following Circle and BitGo. These companies spent 15 years telling people "be your own bank," and now they're lining up to be regulated like it's 1933. 

**The Reasoning** : You can't custody $50B in ETF assets with a hardware wallet and a prayer. As BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF alone hits $30B+, institutions need federally supervised custody, FDIC insurance, and all the traditional banking infrastructure crypto was supposed to make obsolete. 

**Traditional Banks** : Meanwhile, [Citigroup partnered with Coinbase to enhance digital-asset payments for institutional clients](https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/press-release/2025/citi-coinbase-join-forces-boost-digital-asset-payment-capabilities-global-clients), exploring on-chain stablecoin payments for 24/7 real-time conversions. Also, [JPMorgan plans to allow institutional clients globally to use bitcoin](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-24/jpmorgan-to-allow-bitcoin-ether-as-collateral-in-crypto-push) and ether as collateral for loans by year-end. 

**Translation:** When Citigroup needs Coinbase to teach it payments, and JPMorgan (whose CEO called Bitcoin "a fraud" in 2017) accepts it as loan collateral, the crypto revolution didn't fail, the industry that promised to replace banks is becoming banks. 

## 🏗️ The AI Infrastructure Land Grab: Everyone's Scrambling to Control the Backbone

[OpenAI's Nvidia, AMD Deals Boost $1 Trillion AI Boom With Circular Deals - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-10-07/openai-s-nvidia-amd-deals-boost-1-trillion-ai-boom-with-circular-deals)

### 🤝**OpenAI 's $1.5T Handshake Empire: No Bankers, No Lawyers, Just Vibes**

[Sam Altman just orchestrated deals worth up to $1.5T](https://www.ft.com/content/967b0d78-62df-4eea-a441-8ce3a5d03564) with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD, and Broadcom, without hiring a single investment banker or external lawyer. The largest infrastructure deals in tech history were negotiated by his inner circle: CFO Sarah Friar, President Greg Brockman, and a former Deloitte consultant. 

**The Circular Insanity:**

  * **Nvidia:** "Sam and Jensen talk constantly" for $100B in OpenAI to get back $350B in chip orders. 

  * **AMD:** Gave OpenAI warrants for 10% of the company at $0.01 per share for 6GW of chips. 

  * **Oracle:** $300B deal happened because another customer bailed on a Texas data center mid-construction. 

  * **CoreWeave:** OpenAI signed $22B for compute, got $350M in shares that tripled. 




**The Philosophy** : Focus on "technical aspects first" with financial details "coming later." When you're burning $13B annually and valued at $500B, apparently, you negotiate trillion-dollar deals like splitting a bar tab and figure out who owes what later. 

### 📊 Microsoft's OpenAI Black Box: We Lost Money But Won't Say How Much

[Microsoft buried its OpenAI losses in a $4.7B expense line called "other, net,"](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsoft-needs-to-open-up-more-about-its-openai-dealings-59102de8) a hodgepodge category that tells investors nothing. Despite OpenAI hitting a $500B valuation (potentially making Microsoft's stake worth $100B+), Microsoft won't disclose what percentage it owns, the carrying value, or how much of its $13B commitment it's actually funded. 

**The Accounting Gymnastics:** Microsoft calls OpenAI an "equity-method investment" (significant influence) but doesn't list it as a "related party" in disclosures. Morgan Stanley analysts are calling BS: "Transactions may not be conducted at arm's length."

**Reality Check:** Microsoft's $3.9T market cap depends on a company whose losses they won't quantify, ownership they won't clarify, and deals they won't explain. 

### ⚡ The Power Grid Reality: AI or Manufacturing, Not Both

[The Trump admin wants an AI boom AND a manufacturing revival](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-10-24/ai-data-center-boom-threatens-trump-s-manufacturing-revival), but both need GWs of power the grid doesn't have. AI data centers consume 10-50x more power per square foot than traditional centers. Goldman Sachs estimates AI could add 165 TW-hours annually by 2030, equivalent to another entire Northeast US grid. 

**The Result** : Utilities are choosing AI over factories, because tech companies pay faster, sign longer contracts, and don't unionize. Data centers need fiber and power; factories need transportation, labor, and infrastructure. The grid can't support both at the promised scale, so the factories lose.

### 💭 Parting Thoughts

That's a wrap on another week where tech CEOs negotiated military deployments like B2B contracts, and the crypto revolution put on a suit and tie to become the banks it swore to destroy. And the largest infrastructure deals in history got done on handshakes because who needs lawyers when you're burning $13B annually on vibes and Jensen's cell number. 

Remember: when your "partner" is simultaneously your investor, your customer, your competitor, and won't disclose what percentage of you they actually own, you're not in a strategic relationship, you're in whatever accounting category lets them avoid explaining the losses to shareholders.
