Welcome to the week when the US government realized that the best way to outdo China in capitalism is to become China, and Palantir's stock surged 600x earnings, apparently because math died sometime in 2024. 

If you thought the free market was having a moment, wait until you hear about Uncle Sam's shopping spree and the $3T we're spending on AI infrastructure that nobody knows how to monetize. 

###### As we continue to build at [Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/), we've launched [Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/) with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter.

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **US Govt Goes Shopping:** Trump admin wants to use $11B of CHIPS Act money to buy Intel equity after the stock cratered 50% 

  * **$3T AI Infrastructure Bonfire:** Tech world committed to spending $3T on data centers, while 42% of businesses abandoned AI pilots as average ROI sits at a pathetic 5.9% 

  * **Palantir Defies Gravity:** Hit $430B market cap trading at 600x earnings (vs Nvidia's peak of 65x), needs 40% growth for 5 straight years just to justify current valuation 

  * **China 's Open-Source Chess Move:** While the US burns billions on proprietary models, China's flooding the market with free AI that punches above its weight 

  * **Cognition Hits $10B Valuation:** AI coding startup where employees "literally live at work" raised $500M at nearly $10B after acquiring Windsurf's scraps 




## 🏛️ The US Government Wants to Own Intel Because Capitalism is So 2019

Photo by[ René DeAnda](https://unsplash.com/@renedeanda?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on[ Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/architectural-photography-of-white-house-zfKlCKK-Ql0?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash)

### 🎯 Uncle Sam Goes Shopping for Chip Stocks

The [Trump admin is in talks to buy a stake in Intel](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-14/trump-administration-is-said-to-discuss-us-taking-stake-in-intel) using the CHIPS Act funding. The nearly $11B of it that was already promised to Intel would be used to acquire equity in the struggling chipmaker whose stock has cratered 50% since January 2024. 

**The Drama Timeline:**

  * **Last Week:** Trump demands Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan resign "immediately" after Senator Tom Cotton flagged his investments in Chinese companies 

  * **Monday:** Tan meets Trump at the White House for damage control 

  * **After Meeting:** Trump calls Tan's story "amazing" and says they'll work together 

  * **Thursday:** News breaks that the government wants to buy Intel shares 

  * **Market Reaction:** Intel stock jumps 7%, giving it a $105B market cap 




**The Real Backstory:** Intel spent billions trying to build a foundry business, but has no major customers and terrible chip yields. Their CEO was hired to turn things around, similar to his tenure at Cadence, but instead of fixing the company, he's having to explain to Trump why his Malaysian birth and past investments don't make him a Chinese spy. 

### 💸 This Summer's Government Shopping Spree

Intel isn't even [Trump's first rodeo in the "capitalism with Chinese characteristics"](https://www.wsj.com/economy/the-u-s-marches-toward-state-capitalism-with-american-characteristics-f75cafa8) playbook: 

  * **Nvidia & AMD Deal:** Lifted China export bans in exchange for 15% of their China revenues (because nothing says free market like protection money) 

  * **MP Materials:** Defense Department dropped $400M to become the largest shareholder of a rare-earths producer 

  * **US Steel:** Approved Nippon Steel's takeover in exchange for a "golden share" that gives the government veto power 

  * **Intel:** Now seeking an ownership stake to "secure national security" in semiconductors 




**The Bigger Picture:** As the [WSJ's Greg Ip](https://www.wsj.com/economy/the-u-s-marches-toward-state-capitalism-with-american-characteristics-f75cafa8) put it, "capitalism in America is starting to look like China." One tech analyst defended it to CNBC, saying, "We don't want government to intervene and own private enterprise, but this is national security." This overlooks the irony that China's stance is literally the same for every state-owned enterprise. 

## 💰 The $3T AI Infrastructure Boom That Nobody Can Afford

[Level Up Coding on Medium: DeepSeek R1 vs. Qwen 2.5 Max: Simple Comparison](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/deepseek-r1-vs-qwen-2-5-max-simple-comparision-b12d4e751e15)

### 📉 Plot Twist: AI May Not Be Making Money

The AI boom has triggered what might be history's largest infrastructure buildout, with [companies on the hook for $3T](https://www.ft.com/content/efe1e350-62c6-4aa0-a833-f6da01265473)**** in data centers, supercomputers, and power plants. Tech giants, including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta, will burn through **$400B in 2026** after spending $350B this year. 

**Here 's The Irony**: Companies are spending **$61.9B on generative AI in 2025** (up 94% YoY), but [virtually nobody's making money from it](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/13/business/ai-business-payoff-lags.html): 

  * **42% of businesses** abandoned their AI pilot projects by the end of 2024, up from 17% the year before 

  * **Average ROI:** A pathetic 5.9% according to IBM 

  * **McKinsey 's Finding:** 80% of companies use AI, 80% say it hasn't improved profits 

  * **The "Productivity Paradox":** Just like PCs in the 1980s, everyone's buying it but nobody knows why 




**The only winners?** Big Tech companies are showing "early returns" through vague "efficiencies" that Wall Street pretends to understand. 

### 🐉 Meanwhile, China Is Open-Sourcing Its Way to AI Dominance

While America burns trillions on proprietary models, [China is releasing its models for free](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/chinas-lead-in-open-source-ai-jolts-washington-and-silicon-valley-ffdec83b): 

  * **Alibaba 's Qwen3** just beat some of OpenAI's models in reasoning, math, and coding 

  * **DeepSeek 's R1** dropped in January, completely free and crushingly good 

  * Chinese firms are flooding the market with open models while US companies lock theirs behind paywalls 




**The Geopolitical Chess Move:** This seems to be China hedging against future sanctions by making sure its AI is already embedded everywhere. When half the world's developers are building on your free models, good luck sanctioning that. 

## 🎯 Palantir: The $430B Meme Stock That Govt Contracts Built

[Palantir Vision YouTube: What If Alex Karp Is Right? 2030 PLTR Price Predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYkm6pPWxYk)

### 📈 Trading at 600x Earnings Because Math is Dead

[Palantir just hit a $430B market cap](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/08/12/palantir-might-be-the-most-overvalued-firm-of-all-time), making it worth more than 99% of the S&P; 500 while trading at: 

  * **600x earnings** (for context, even Nvidia at peak hype was 65x) 

  * **120x sales** (historically, anything over 30x underperforms the market) 

  * **Rule of 40 Score:** 94 (impressive until you realize it needs to maintain this for a decade to justify the price) 




To grow into its valuation at Google's peak multiple (22x sales), Palantir needs to **5.6x its revenue** , which requires 40% annual growth for five straight years with zero hiccups. 

### 🕵️ The Palantir Mafia: Silicon Valley's New Shadow Network

Forget the PayPal Mafia, as [there's a new Palantir alumni network](https://www.wsj.com/tech/the-palantir-mafia-behind-silicon-valleys-hottest-startups-f6e9bcbb) running the Valley, and they learned to code in war zones: 

  * **350+ companies** founded or funded by Palantir alumni 

  * Names like Garry Tan (Y Combinator), Joe Lonsdale (8VC), and Barry McCardel (Hex) are pulling strings 

  * They coordinate on Signal, recruit at Halloween parties, and do deals at river retreats 




**Why They 're Different:** Palantir's "forward-deployed engineers" are embedded with the CIA and oil rigs, learning to build software in hostile environments. Now they're applying that same energy to startups in defense, govtech, and other sectors too boring for normal VCs. 

**Reality Check:** Palantir's stock is up 5x because investors think AI + government contracts = infinite money printer. But at 600x earnings, they're betting Palantir becomes the Matrix: omniscient, omnipresent, and running everything. 

## ⚡ Startup Quick Hits: From Living at the Office to Wiring Your Brain

[20VC with Harry Stebbings: Cognition CEO Scott Wu on Acquiring Windsurf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz060_Kn0F0)

**💻**[Cognition's $10B Valuation Comes with Sleepovers](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/start-ups/ai-coding-start-up-cognition-raises-500m-in-new-funding-round-wsj)**:** The AI coding startup raised $500M from Founders Fund at a nearly $10B valuation, which is a casual 2.5x jump from $4B in March. CEO Scott Wu proudly announced his team "literally live where we work" and "do our best work late into the night," as they just cleaned house with Windsurf. 

🎯****[Cohere Hits $6.8B & Throws Shade at Consumer AI](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/cohere-hits-a-6-8b-valuation-as-investors-amd-nvidia-and-salesforce-double-down/)**:** The Toronto-based LLM maker raised $500M led by Radical Ventures and Inovia Capital, jumping from $5.5B to $6.8B valuation in just a year. Cohere is focused on the enterprise market and even took a swipe at OpenAI and Anthropic for selling "repurposed consumer models."

🧠****[OpenAI Backs Brain Chip Startup](https://www.ft.com/content/04484164-724e-4fc2-92a2-e2c13ea639bd)**:** Merge Labs is raising $250M at an $850M valuation with OpenAI leading. Altman will be a co-founder alongside Worldcoin's Alex Blania, but won't handle day-to-day operations. Back in 2017, Altman wrote that humans must either merge with AI or become "the biological bootloader for digital intelligence."

## ⚡ VC Quick Hits: From Woodworking YouTubers to War Profiteering

[YouTube Channel: Jonathan Katz-Moses](https://www.youtube.com/@katzmosestools)

🪓****[Slow Ventures Invests $2M to a Woodworking Guy](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/slow-ventures-cuts-first-check-from-60m-creator-fund-into-woodworking-founder/)**:** The firm deployed its first investment from its $60M Creator Fund into Jonathan Katz-Moses, a woodworking YouTuber with 600K followers and 75M views who sells his own line of tools. Slow partner Billy Parks flew to Santa Barbara to visit his 30,000-square-foot shop, convinced that it would bring in venture-scale returns. 

📊****[Ex-OpenAI Researcher Launches $25M Fund to Stalk GitHub Commits](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-12/-ex-openai-researcher-raises-fund-to-back-emerging-talent)**:** Jenny Xiao's Leonis Capital raised $25M to back AI researchers before they've built anything sellable, using in-house software to creep on GitHub contributions and academic papers like a technical talent stalker. The fund is backed by insiders from Nvidia, OpenAI, and Anthropic. 

🤖****[xAI Co-Founder Ditches Musk to Start AI Safety Fund](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/co-founder-of-elon-musks-xai-departs-the-company/)**:** Igor Babuschkin is leaving xAI to launch Babuschkin Ventures, focused on "AI safety research" and helping humanity flourish. Babuschkin says he learned two "priceless lessons" from Elon: be fearless and have maniacal urgency. Nothing says "AI safety" like ditching as an xAI co-founder after the PR nightmare. 

**💣**[Porsche & Deutsche Telekom Anchor €500M Defense Fund](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-13/porsche-deutsche-telekom-in-talks-to-anchor-500-million-defense-fund)**:** DTCP is raising a €500M fund for European defense tech, with Porsche's holding company dropping its cute "dual-use only" restriction to go full military-industrial complex. European military spending is surging, and nothing says "luxury sports cars" like investing in companies that make things that go boom.

### 💭 Parting Thoughts

So there you have it: America's spending $3T on AI that doesn't make money, the government's buying tech companies like it's Black Friday, and a woodworking YouTuber just got venture funding because why the hell not. 

When Palantir trades at 600x earnings and the solution to China's tech dominance is "let's become China," you know we've officially entered the "hold my beer and watch this" phase of late-stage capitalism.
