This week, Silicon Valley hit a new low when Meta paid Google $10B to help compete against... Google. Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong hosted a Saturday shame meeting to fire engineers who wouldn't install AI tools. 

###### As we continue to build at [Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/), we've launched [Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/) with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter.

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **Meta 's $10B Own Goal:** Zuck pays Google $10B for cloud services to compete against... Google, funding his rival's AI war chest in the dumbest deal of 2025 

  * **Apple 's AI Panic Tour:** Desperately courting OpenAI, Anthropic, and now Google's Gemini because Siri is so bad that GPT-2 would be an upgrade 

  * **Intel 's Corporate Welfare Era:** SoftBank drops $2B for 2% stake while US govt wants 10% equity for $8B, proving socialism is fine when it's for semiconductors 

  * **Coinbase 's Saturday Night Massacre:** Brian Armstrong hosts weekend shame meeting to fire engineers who won't install AI tools, peak Silicon Valley dystopia 

  * **FieldAI 's Robot Revolution:** Raises $405M (two rounds at once) for "embodied AI" while Nuro bleeds from $8.6B to $6B after ditching delivery bots 




## 🎁 Last Chance: $50K in Founder AI Tools

## 🤝 Big Tech's Desperate AI Scramble

### 💸 Meta Just Paid Google $10B to Help Beat Google

In the most Silicon Valley plot twist since Elon bought Twitter to destroy it,[ Meta just signed a $10+B cloud deal with Google](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-signs-10-billion-plus-cloud-deal-google) while actively trying to crush them in AI. 

**The Absolutely Bonkers Deal:**

  * **$10+B over 6 years** : One of Google Cloud's largest deals ever 

  * **" Hundreds of billions"**: What Zuck plans to spend total on AI infrastructure 

  * **The irony** : Meta is literally funding Google's AI war chest to compete against Google's AI 

  * **Also included** : Access to Nvidia GPUs in Google's data centers (because of course) 




**The Desperation Index:**

  * Meta already uses AWS and Azure, but apparently needs ALL the clouds 

  * Running its own data centers wasn't enough for Zuck's AI dreams 

  * Google is happily taking money from direct competitors (also has an OpenAI deal) 

  * Meta is essentially subsidizing its rival's R&D; budget 




**Why This Matters** : Meta is so desperate to win at AI that it's willing to fund its competitors. 

### 🍎 Apple's Pathetic AI Shopping Spree

[Meet Google Pixel 10 Pro With Gemini | The New Status Pro](https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-xl/)

**Apple 's Desperation Tour: **Meanwhile,[ Apple is desperately speed-dating every AI company](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/apple-explores-using-google-gemini-ai-to-power-revamped-siri), hoping someone will save Siri from being the tech industry's biggest embarrassment. 

  * **Already working with** : OpenAI (because they had to start somewhere) 

  * **Currently flirting with** : Anthropic and now Google's Gemini 

  * **The prize** : Access to iOS's billions of users 

  * **The problem** : Siri is so bad that even GPT-2 would be an upgrade 




**The Three-Year iPhone "Reinvention": **[Apple is launching iPhone 17 Pro](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-24/apple-to-launch-iphone-17-pro-iphone-17-air-in-september-iphone-fold-next-year-mepmzpcj) and mysteriously thin "iPhone 17 Air."

  * Cook promises to "reinvent" the iPhone (translation: add AI because we're late) 

  * Planning foldable iPhone for next year (Samsung had one in 2019) 

  * Magic Cue AI feature is already being done better by Google's Pixel 10 




**Meanwhile at Google** : [They dropped the Pixel 10](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/google-unveils-pixel-10-lineup-new-ai-features) with new AI and camera features that actually work, complete with a Jimmy Fallon-hosted launch event. 

  * **Magic Cue** : Uses Google AI to get info from the relevant apps on your device and offer proactive tips and actions in texts. 

  * **Made by Google** : This hardware event was Google’s attempt to outdo Apple in its poor rollout of Apple Intelligence. 

  * **Alphabet Stock** : Didn't budge because everyone knows hardware isn't its thing. 




**Bottom Line** : The entire tech industry is now one massive circular dependency where everyone competes with, relies on, and pays each other simultaneously. 

## 💀 Intel's Desperate Dance with Uncle Sam & Masa Son

[The White House: President Donald Trump delivers remarks on Investing in America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gallery/president-donald-trump-delivers-remarks-on-investing-in-america/)

### 🏦 The $12B Question Nobody Wants to Answer

Intel has just become the tech industry's most expensive welfare case, with [SoftBank investing $2B in the struggling chipmaker](https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20250819). 

**SoftBank 's $2B Gamble: **Masa Son is buying 87M shares at $23! 

  * **Gets a modest 2% stake** in a company that posted a $2.9B quarterly loss 

  * **Part of Son 's $100B pledge** to Trump (announced at that surreal press conference) 

  * **SoftBank 's track record**: WeWork (-$10B), Uber (-$5B), and now... Intel? 




### 🏛️ Uncle Sam's Even Dumber Play

**US Govt in for Intel** : [Treasury Sec Scott Bessent confirms talks for a 10% equity stake in Intel](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/19/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-treasury-secretary-scott-bessent.html): 

  * **The Terms** : Would convert $8B in CHIPS Act funds into ownership 

  * **The Kicker** : Bessent says they won’t pressure companies to buy Intel chips 

  * "The last thing we're going to do is take the stake and then try to drum up business."




**Wait, What?** You're telling me the government wants to spend $8B of taxpayer money on Intel equity, NOT require anyone actually to buy Intel products, and call it a national security win? 

**Bottom Line:** We're watching the most expensive episode of corporate socialism in tech history, where the government and SoftBank are having a contest to see who can waste billions faster on a company that refuses to admit why it's failing.
