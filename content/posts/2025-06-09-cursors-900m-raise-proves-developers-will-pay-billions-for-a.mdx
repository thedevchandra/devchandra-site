Let's dive deeper into what is trending this past week in startups! 

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **Cursor 's coding craze**: This AI tool just raised $900M at a $9.9B valuation, proving that devs will pay for AI that can write decent code. 

  * **M &A; is back & VC funding is down**: Startup M&A; surged to a monthly high of $24.7B, while May venture funding dropped 13%. 

  * **OpenAI 's buying binge of $9.5B**: And other AI startups also continue to hog the spotlight with $5.9B in fresh cash. 

  * **Circle IPOed and surged 48%** : On its second day of trading, it hit $123.49, valuing the stablecoin issuer at $ 32.1 B. 

  * **Don’t sleep on Latam** : Nascent VC just raised Fund II (7x larger than the first fund), targeting early LatAm startups. 




## 🤖 AI Code Assistant Craze

### 🚀 Cursor’s Anysphere Rockets to $9.9B

[Cursor just hit a $9.9B valuation from raising a $900M](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/cursors-anysphere-nabs-9-9b-valuation-soars-past-500m-arr/) round led by Thrive and a16z, proving that developers will pay big bucks for AI that can write decent code. The startup's revenue has been doubling every two months and recently crossed $500M in ARR. Not bad for a 3-year-old company that helps programmers avoid programming. 

**Translation** : There is a massive appetite from investors for AI coding tools that work. 

## 📉 Market Pulse

### ✍️ Global VC Funding Cools, M&A; Heats Up

[Global venture funding hit $21.8B](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/data-global-monthly-funding-may-2025/?utm_source=cb_weekend&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20250607) in May, sliding 13% from the previous quarter as investors continued their cautious approach. Meanwhile, startup M&A; activity heated up with $24.7B in deals, marking the second-largest month since early 2024: 

  * **OpenAI** led the shopping spree for Sir Jony Ive’s hardware startup, Io ($6.5B), and coding startup, Windsurf ($3B) 

  * **DoorDash** scooped up **SevenRooms** ($1.2B), a hospitality tech startup 

  * **DataBricks** acquired Postgres database Neon ($1B) 




**Translation** : New money is tighter, but strategics are opening their wallets. 

### 📈 Circle’s NYSE IPO Goes Lunar

**Stablecoin** giant Circle's shares climbed 48% on Friday, extending the stock's blockbuster NYSE debut, which saw the [shares nearly quadruple from their $31 offer price](https://www.reuters.com/business/stablecoin-firm-circle-scales-record-high-after-blockbuster-nyse-listing-2025-06-06/) to a high of $123.49. The stellar performance is indicating the IPO market's recovery, with analysts noting that companies less exposed to tariff uncertainties are finding strong investor appetite. 

**More Context** : As last month, the IPO market was pretty dull, with only [five companies going public at valuations above $1B](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/data-global-monthly-funding-may-2025/?utm_source=cb_weekend&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20250607): 

  1. **eToro:** Israel-based social trading platform 

  2. **Hinge Health:** San Francisco-based digital clinic 

  3. **Shanghai Auntie:** Shanghai-based tea company 

  4. **Ather Energy:** India-based electric scooter manufacturer 

  5. **MNTN:** Austin, Texas-based advertising platform 




**Translation** : Wall Street seems optimistic about IPO momentum, especially in sectors such as AI, defense, and fintech, which are shielded from international trade risks. 

### 🌎 LatAm Capital Shows Promise

### 💼 Nascent VC Unveils $15 M Operator-Led Fund II

Mexico's Nascent VC, backed by the founders of Kavak, Bitso, and Belvo,[ has raised its second fund of $15M](https://contxto.com/en/venture-capital-es/operator-led-nascent-vc-announces-the-launch-of-its-15-million-fund-ii/). Being 7x larger than the debut vehicle, Fund II aims to write $500K checks into "pre-PowerPoint" stage fintech, proptech, e-commerce, and AI startups. The first fund has already delivered a 6.5x gross return with 5.2x distributed to investors. 

**Translation** : The Latam space is one not to sleep on as these boots-on-the-ground operators are doubling down on early-stage Latin America talent.
