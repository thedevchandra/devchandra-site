This week, Silicon Valley proved that throwing money at AI infrastructure is easy; using it efficiently is hard. OpenAI's $400B Stargate looks less impressive when you realize 75% of the industry's GPUs maybe sitting idle. 

###### As we continue to build at [Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/), we've launched [Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/) with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter.

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **Stargate Accelerates AI Empire** : OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announce five new data center sites representing 7 GWs & $400B+ investment 

  * **Apple 's $3,500 Vision Pro Retreat**: Apple shelves cheaper Vision Pro development to chase Meta-style smart glasses instead 

  * **AI Eats All VC** : VCs pour $192.7B into AI startups in 2025, making this year the first where over 50% of all VC funding flows to one sector 

  * **The $300B Efficiency Disaster** : Despite AI infra spending exceeding $300B in 2025, over 75% of companies run GPUs below 70% utilization 

  * **$5B Valuation Before Shipping Product** : Former Databricks VP raising $1B at $5B valuation for AI hardware startup Unconventional 




## 💸 Spending $Bs on AI Infrastructure Nobody Knows How to Use

[OpenAI: AMD & OpenAI announce strategic partnership to deploy 6 GW of AMD GPUs](https://openai.com/index/openai-amd-strategic-partnership/)

### 🚀 OpenAI Becomes Earth's Most Valuable Startup at $500B While Hoarding All the GPUs

OpenAI just [completed a $6.6B secondary sale at a $500B valuation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-02/openai-completes-share-sale-at-record-500-billion-valuation) (up $200B since earlier this year), making it the most valuable and worth more than SpaceX and ByteDance. 

At the same time, they signed deals for [6GW of AMD GPUs](https://openai.com/index/openai-amd-strategic-partnership/) and getting [Samsung and SK to commit 900,000 DRAM wafer starts per month](https://openai.com/index/samsung-and-sk-join-stargate/) to feed their infrastructure addiction: 

  * **160M AMD shares:** Warrants that vest as OpenAI deploys 6GW of AMD Instinct GPUs starting H2 2026 

  * **900,000 wafers/month:** Samsung and SK hynix ramping memory production just for OpenAI's models 

  * **Korea goes all-in:** Samsung C&T;, Heavy Industries, SDS, and SK Telecom building data centers across the country 




**The Bottom Line:** OpenAI is worth half a trillion dollars while burning $13B annually, and their solution is to get AMD, Samsung, and entire countries' semiconductor industries to bet everything on AGI arriving before the money runs out. 

### 🏢 Wall Street Discovers Data Centers Are the New Manhattan Real Estate

BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners is [closing in on a $40B deal to acquire Aligned Data Centers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-03/gip-nears-deal-to-buy-aligned-data-centers-for-about-40-billion): 

  * **$40B valuation:** Bigger than most REITs, and they're not even selling coffee 

  * **78 data centers:** A continental AI real estate portfolio 

  * **5GW capacity:** When fully built out, that's a small country's worth of power 

  * **$3.4B potential revenue:** Once all that silicon starts humming 




Aligned just raised $12B to scale from 600MW operational to 5GW total. That's not a tech play; that's infrastructure empire-building on a scale that would make railroad barons jealous. 

**Reality Check:** When Wall Street's biggest infrastructure fund treats GPU warehouses like core real estate assets, we're not betting on algorithms anymore; we're betting on who owns the land. 

### 🏗️ Microsoft's $33B Confession: We Can't Build Fast Enough

Microsoft just [committed over $33B to neocloud providers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-02/microsoft-neocloud-deals-a-strategy-for-ai-supply-crunch) like Nebius, CoreWeave, and Lambda: 

  * **$33B outsourced:** More than NASA's annual budget, going to other people's servers 

  * **100,000 GB300 chips:** From Nebius alone, available now instead of 2027 

  * **$19.4B to Nebius:** One deal that's bigger than most IPOs 

  * **Off the books:** These are OpEx, not CapEx, so Wall Street can't complain about spending 




**Translation** : The company that literally invented "cloud computing at scale" is now someone else's biggest tenant. They're renting capacity that's already live while their own data centers are still PowerPoint slides. 

**Meanwhile:** Google's quietly doing the same thing but keeping it low-key, and Amazon hasn't announced similar moves yet; they're either not desperate enough or have better PR. 

### 💸 The $300B GPU Graveyard Nobody Talks About

AI infrastructure spending [will blow past $300B in 2025](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-03/ai-is-dominating-2025-vc-investing-pulling-in-192-7-billion), but here's the dirty secret: [over 75% of organizations run their GPUs below 70% utilization](https://observer.com/2025/10/ai-infrastructure-crisis-300-billion/): 

  * **$300B+ investment:** Led by the usual suspects writing checks that would make defense contractors blush 

  * **&lt; 70% utilization:** Three-quarters of companies can't keep their expensive silicon busy 

  * **The gap:** Between buying GPUs and knowing how to use them is measured in billions 




**Reality Check:** Companies are panic-buying H100s, then discovering they don't have the data pipelines, orchestration systems, or basic competence to actually use them. This isn't an infrastructure arms race; it's an infrastructure hoarding crisis. 

## 🔄 Big Tech's Identity Crisis: Copying, Chaos & Court Orders

[Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/)

### 👓 Apple Just Admitted the Vision Pro Was a $3,500 Mistake

Apple [shelved development of a cheaper Vision Pro to chase Meta's smart glasses](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-01/apple-shelves-vision-headset-revamp-to-prioritize-meta-like-ai-smart-glasses): 

  * **Vision Pro 2.0:** Cancelled mid-development after realizing nobody wants to pay even $1,750 for face computers 

  * **New priority:** Copying Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses that actually sell 

  * **Timeline:** First Apple glasses in 2027-2028, years behind Meta's head start 

  * **The admission:** Lightweight AI on your face beats $3,500 ski goggles for lonely movie watching 




**The Bottom Line:** When you're Apple and you're following instead of leading, that's not strategy; that's panic dressed up in Jony Ive's minimalist packaging. They spent years mocking Zuckerberg's metaverse, only to realize consumers want AI assistants that don't make them look like they're training for the Olympics. 

### 🔬 Meta's AI Godfather Threatens to Rage Quit Over Publishing Rules

Meta's foundational AI research lab FAIR [changed its publishing rules](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-change-publishing-research-causes-stir-ai-group), and the reaction was nuclear: 

  * **New gatekeeping:** FAIR researchers now need corporate approval before publishing, crushing the academic culture that built Meta's AI credibility. 

  * **Yann LeCun 's rebellion:** The guy who literally invented modern AI at Meta threatened to bounce over restrictions he called "antithetical to scientific progress."

  * **The whiplash:** Meta recruited top talent with promises of openness, then pulled the rug. 




**Translation** : Meta can't decide if it's a tech company that does research or a research institution that makes products. This strategic confusion is precisely what happens when you're terrified of both OpenAI and your own researchers. 

### ⚖️ Google's $26B Apple Addiction Gets Court-Ordered Rehab

A federal judge has just [dismantled Google's search empire](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/google-avoids-breakup-but-has-to-give-up-exclusive-search-deals-in-antitrust-trial/), ordering it to end exclusive deals, including the $26 billion annual payment to Apple, and share its precious search data with competitors. 

**What Google Lost:**

  * **Exclusive deals:** Can't lock up default search placement anymore 

  * **Data moat:** Must share search index with "qualified competitors" (aka everyone) 

  * **AI advantage:** Every ChatGPT wannabe gets access to Google's training data 

  * **The pretense:** That they're not a monopoly 




**What Google Kept:**

  * **Its existence:** Judge rejected breaking them up (for now) 

  * **Payment ability:** Can still throw money at Apple, just not exclusively 

  * **Ad data:** The real goldmine stays locked up 




**The Kicker:** The court specifically cited "competition from generative AI" as a reason to limit remedies. Google spent decades building an impenetrable search monopoly, only to have both regulators and ChatGPT attack it simultaneously. 

## 💸 Startup Quick Hits: VC Throwing Money Everywhere

🧠****[Wafer-Scale Wizards' Mega Funding Spree](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/cerebras-closes-11bn-funding-round-at-18bn-valuation/): Cerebras Systems raised $1.1B in a Series G round at an $8.1B valuation, led by Fidelity Management. In the AI hardware arms race, they're proving that massive silicon can translate to even more massive investment checks. 

🚀****[Supabase's Open-Source Rocket Fuel](https://fortune.com/2025/10/03/exclusive-supabase-raises-100-million-at-5-billion-valuation-as-vibe-coding-soars/): Raised $100M in Series E at a $5B valuation, bringing total funding to over $500M since 2020 with 4M developers onboard. Turns out, building an open-source Firebase alternative is worth more than just street cred in the AI-powered dev world. 

**🔍**[PostHog's Unicorn Leap into AI Analytics](https://technews180.com/funding-news/posthog-raises-75m-series-e-reaches-unicorn-status/): PostHog raised $75M in Series E, valuing the open-source analytics platform at $1.4B and officially joining the unicorn club. Who knew tracking product metrics could be a ticket to the billion-dollar startup carnival? 

🧠****[Unconventional's $5B Pre-Product Payday](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/sources-naveen-raos-new-ai-hardware-startup-targets-5b-valuation-with-backing-from-a16z/): Former Databricks VP Naveen Rao is raising $1B led by a16z at a $5B valuation for his AI hardware startup that hasn't shipped a product yet. Apparently "new substrate for intelligence" is worth $5B in PowerPoint form. 

## 💸 Investor Quick Hits: When Money Chases Monopolies

🎰 [AI Devours 52.5% of All VC Money](https://www.airosetta.com/news/ai-capital-2025-unipolar?language=en): A Historic First**:** VCs have pumped $192.7B into AI startups in 2025, marking the first time ever that over half of all VC flows to a single industry. The remaining $174B gets split between healthcare, fintech, climate tech, and every other sector combined. Last time VCs went this all-in? The dot-com era. 

**✈️** [European AI Startups Take American Money, Keep the Accent](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/europes-ai-startups-look-stateside-for-bigger-checks-quicker-deals-1a1dff43)**:** US VCs invested $14.2B in European AI companies this year, as founders bypass local investors who can't match Silicon Valley's check sizes. With American VCs raising 10x more capital than European counterparts ($50B vs $5B for AI alone), Europe's "digital sovereignty" dreams are getting Delaware C-corps. 

**🌏** [Asia's VC Market Cuts in Half as Non-AI Startups Starve](https://www.asiatechreview.com/p/southeast-asias-vc-funding-landscape)**:** Asian VC cratered to $48.9B in nine months, barely half of 2024's total. China hit decade lows with Q2 dropping to $4.7B, while Japan and India only grew in AI/deeptech. The money didn't disappear; it just decided Asia's non-AI startups aren't worth the flight. 

## 👥 IPO & M&A; Quick Hits: Layoffs, Leaps, and Lucrative Exits

🚀****[OpenAI's Rocket Past SpaceX](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-02/openai-completes-share-sale-at-record-500-billion-valuation): Staff sold $6.6B in shares at a $500B valuation, making it the world's most valuable startup ahead of SpaceX's $400-425B. Turns out chatbots that write code beat actual rockets to space—at least on paper. 

**🎮**[EA's Debt-Fueled Future](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-10-03/ea-s-deal-to-go-private-could-be-good-for-investors-bad-for-employees?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1OTUxNDcxMSwiZXhwIjoxNzYwMTE5NTExLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUM0tJMjVHUEw0RjEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iA7GI5OjfFux2QwKoVP30rMIaEMmQsGf11OVaTZ5RWc): EA's $55B acquisition saddled the gaming giant with $20B in debt that will consume a big portion of its cash flow, with even bullish analysts expecting major layoffs. Turns out the real game over is when your business model becomes 'make games, pay bankers.'

**⚡**[Fermi's Zero-Revenue $19B Power Trip](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-01/rick-perry-s-energy-reit-fermi-jumps-19-after-683-million-ipo): Data center REIT Fermi, co-founded by former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, popped 55% on its Nasdaq debut to a $19.3B valuation, less than a year after founding and with zero revenue. 

**🌍**[DoorDash's £2.9B Overseas Delivery](https://t.co/3O0xdEo4Du): DoorDash closed its £2.9B (~$3.9B) Deliveroo acquisition on October 2. Miki Kuusi, the co-founder of 2022 acquisition Wolt, was installed as the new CEO after founder Will Shu's exit.

### 💭 Parting Thoughts

OpenAI just became the most valuable startup in history while committing nearly a trillion dollars between its valuation and infrastructure spending, all for a company that loses money on every query. 

When you're burning enough electricity to power Connecticut and your business model is "AGI will save us," you're either witnessing the birth of the future or the most spectacular crater capitalism has ever dug.
