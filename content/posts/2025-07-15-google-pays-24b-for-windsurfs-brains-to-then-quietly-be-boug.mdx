Good morning! This week, Big Tech is playing musical chairs with entire startups, valuations have entered full fantasy mode, and even the most established VC firms are either fleeing Delaware or weathering Twitter storms. 

As we continue to build at [Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/), we've launched [Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/) with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter. 

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **Talent Heist:** Google pays $2.4B for Windsurf's brains to then quietly be bought out. 

  * **Space Madness:** SpaceX seeks $400B valuation while investing $2B in Musk's xAI startup. 

  * **AI Bubble:** Groq chases $6B valuation after landing massive $1.5B Saudi Arabia contract. 

  * **Unicorn Alert:** LangChain reaches a $1.1B valuation, helping developers build better AI applications. 

  * **Corporate Exodus:** A16z ditches Delaware for Nevada, citing biased tech courts. 

  * **Controversy Management:** Sequoia stays silent as partner's inflammatory posts spark backlash. 




## 🌪️ Windsurf Gets Caught in Big Tech's Perfect Storm

### 🏴‍☠️ Google Pulls a $2.4B Talent Heist, Leaves Windsurf in the Dust

[Google just paid $2.4B to license Windsurf's AI coding tech](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-to-pay-2-4-billion-in-deal-to-license-tech-of-coding-startup-hire-ceo-b9b94bbc) and poach CEO Varun Mohan plus key engineers, after OpenAI's $3B buyout talks imploded over Microsoft drama: 

  * **Not a Real Acquisition** : Google gets no ownership stake in Windsurf, just acquiring top talent and access to the tech. 

  * **The Winners** : Investors, such as Kleiner Perkins and Green Oaks, walk away with solid returns, while vested employees cash out handsomely. 

  * **The Losers** : The remaining 250 employees are left with $100M cash and get a new CEO to run what's left of the gutted company. 




This "license-and-lift" strategy is becoming Big Tech's favorite move (e.g., Microsoft's Inflection grab or Google's [Character.AI](https://Character.AI) deal). It's faster than an actual acquisition and dodges regulatory scrutiny, but creates a toxic precedent where founders get rich while regular employees get left with worthless equity. 

But wait, there’s more… 

### 🚀 Cognition Picks Up the Pieces by Buying What's Left of Windsurf

Then, the company behind AI coding agent Devin, [Cognition, quietly bought up whatever was left of Windsurf](https://cognition.ai/blog/windsurf): 

  * **Bubble Territory:** This Windsurf saga represents peak madness in AI coding, with the valuations being crazy high: Cursor is going at 20x revenue while Lovable is reportedly seeking 40x multiples. 

  * **Cautionary Tale:** Companies that lose their founding teams in these reverse-acquihires typically don't fare well. Scale AI hemorrhaged customers after its Meta deal, and Inflection completely pivoted from consumer AI after Microsoft came in. 




Cognition's move seems pretty clever. By acquiring Windsurf's assets, they're building a unified vision that combines autonomous coding agents with smart IDEs. It's positioning them as a serious threat to GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and others. 

## 🚀 Elon's Space Empire Hits Warp Speed

[YC YouTube: Elon Musk: Digital Superintelligence, Multiplanetary Life, How to Be Useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFIlta1GkiE)

### 💰 SpaceX Shoots for the Moon with $400B Valuation

[SpaceX is reportedly in talks to raise fresh capital to achieve a whopping $400B valuation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-08/spacex-valuation-said-to-hit-around-400-billion-in-share-sale), up from $350B just six months ago. To put that in perspective, the company has nearly doubled its value since mid-2023 when it was "only" worth $210B. Here’s the math: 

  * Share price is hitting around $212 per share in this new round 

  * Deal includes both fresh funding and a tender offer for employees to cash out 

  * SpaceX now dominates 84% of all space launches globally 

  * Starlink accounts for two-thirds of all satellites currently orbiting Earth 




Starlink is essentially printing money in space, while Starship represents humanity's best chance at becoming a multi-planetary species. If this deal closes, SpaceX becomes the most valuable private company, surpassing even OpenAI and ByteDance. 

And SpaceX is getting involved in xAI… 

### 🤖 The Musk Money Circle: SpaceX Drops $2B on xAI's $200B Dreams

[SpaceX is backing xAI's latest fundraising round to the tune of $2B](https://www.wsj.com/tech/spacex-to-invest-2-billion-into-elon-musks-xai-413934de). Being xAI's third fundraising round in just two months, it is seeking a jaw-dropping $200B valuation. Here’s the math: 

  * SpaceX's $2B represents nearly half of xAI's $5B round led by Morgan Stanley 

  * xAI recently merged with X (formerly Twitter), creating an AI-social media hybrid 

  * This follows Musk's classic playbook of using his companies to prop each other up 




Musk has a history of shifting resources between his ventures, much like a corporate shell game. He moved Tesla and SpaceX employees to help fix Twitter, and Tesla shareholders once sued him for overpaying to acquire SolarCity (and he won that case). 

## ⚡ Startup Quick Hits

🔥****[Groq Wants $6B to Take on Nvidia](https://www.ft.com/content/25aab987-c2a1-4fca-8883-38a617269b68)**:** The AI chip startup is raising $300-500M at a $6B valuation (more than doubling from $2.8B) after landing a massive $1.5B contract with Saudi Arabia. They're expecting $500M in revenue this year from their inference chips that promise to make AI faster and cheaper than Nvidia's GPUs. 

🦄****[LangChain Hit Unicorn Status](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2025/07/09/ai-startup-langchain-is-in-talks-to-raise-100-million/)**:** The AI developer tools company raised $100M at a $1.1B valuation led by IVP. With clients like Uber and LinkedIn using their LangSmith platform, they're pulling in $12-16M annually, helping developers build better LLM applications. 

🧮****[Harmonic: Robinhood's Vlad Builds Math AI](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250710118878/en/Harmonic-Raises-%24100-Million-Series-B-to-Accelerate-Development-of-Mathematical-Superintelligence)**:** The startup, with Robinhood's Vlad Tenev as Executive Chairman, raised a Series B at $875M valuation from Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia, and others. They're building "mathematical superintelligence" with their flagship model, Aristotle, which is launching this year to tackle complex math problems. 

## ⚡ VC Quick Hits

[A16z YouTube: How Andreessen Horowitz Disrupted VC & What’s Coming Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpBDB2NjaWY)

**🏃‍♂️**[Andreessen Horowitz Ditches Delaware for Nevada](https://a16z.com/were-leaving-delaware-and-we-think-you-should-consider-leaving-too/)**:** A16z is moving from Delaware to Nevada, citing the Delaware Court of Chancery's "unprecedented subjectivity" and bias against tech founders. The biggest VC firm in the country hopes their move signals to portfolio companies that Nevada's business-friendly courts are a viable alternative to Delaware's increasingly unpredictable judicial landscape. 

🤐****[Sequoia Bets on Silence Over Shaun Maguire Controversy](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/sequoia-bets-on-silence/)**:** When partner Shaun Maguire called a NYC mayoral candidate an "Islamist" who "comes from a culture that lies," Sequoia chose radio silence over damage control. Despite 1,000+ petition signatures demanding action, the firm is banking on Maguire's deal flow (he led the $1.1B Bridge acquisition by Stripe) outweighing the backlash. 

🤖****[Solo GP Sarah Smith Raises $16M, Says AI Is Her Secret Weapon](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/sarah-smith-launches-16m-fund-says-ai-can-unlock-so-much-for-solo-gps-like-herself/)**:** The former Bain Capital Ventures investor closed her debut fund and claims AI lets her deliver "10x value in 1/10 of the time." She's targeting 50 companies, with an average check of $250K, focusing exclusively on the Stanford ecosystem, where she says 11% of unicorn founders have ties.
