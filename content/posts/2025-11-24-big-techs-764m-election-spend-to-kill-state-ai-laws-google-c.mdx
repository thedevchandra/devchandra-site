## 🎪 The $764M Regulatory Heist: Big Tech Buys Fed Control

[All-In Podcast: Winning the AI Race Part 5: President Trump on the AI Action Plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmxbPH1PL_A)

### 💸 Big Tech Dropped $764M to Erase State AI Laws

[Big Tech spent $764.5M during the 2024 election cycle](https://www.citizen.org/news/1-1-billion-in-big-tech-political-spending-fuels-attacks-on-state-ai-laws/), with nearly three-quarters flowing to Republicans, and now they're cashing in: 

  * **$1.1B total:** Campaign spending, lobbying, and political influence combined 

  * **~$380M to GOP:** Elon Musk alone contributed nearly half 

  * **Second Only to Pharma:** Tech's lobbying muscle now rivals Big Pharma's stranglehold on DC 




**The Prize?** A provision tucked into the National Defense Authorization Act that would preempt state AI regulations and centralize control in DC, where industry lobbying reigns supreme. 

**Translation:** States passed bipartisan laws addressing AI deepfakes, workplace surveillance, and algorithmic discrimination. Tech executives saw democracy working at the local level and decided to buy a federal override instead. OpenAI and Anthropic are already backing the push, craving the "predictability" that comes from negotiating with one government instead of fifty. 

### ⚖️ Federal AI Power Grab Dies on Bipartisan Hill

[The White House paused a draft executive order](https://www.reuters.com/world/white-house-pauses-executive-order-that-would-seek-preempt-state-laws-ai-sources-2025-11-21/) that would have steamrolled state AI laws—but not before triggering bipartisan backlash. 

[The Proposed Order](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/824608/trump-executive-order-ai-state-laws): Ominously titled "Eliminating State Law Obstruction of National AI Policy," it would have created an "AI Litigation Task Force" to sue states into submission while withholding federal funding from non-compliant jurisdictions. 

**Trump’s Position** : [The President is still calling on Congress](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-18/trump-urges-congress-to-block-state-level-ai-regulation) to block state-level AI regulation entirely, warning that a "patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes" will hand China the AI crown. 

**The Irony:**[ Prominent Republicans are publicly opposing federal preemption](https://www.ft.com/content/6585fb32-8a86-4ffb-a940-06b17e06345a), arguing that federal seizure of jurisdiction is "not a direction, generally, you'd want to go." The GOP's commitment to states' rights—usually deployed for culture war issues—is accidentally creating the regulatory fragmentation Silicon Valley fears most. 

**Bottom Line:** Everyone agrees AI needs rules, but nobody agrees who should write them. Big Tech is playing both sides, lobbying for "uniform standards" while quietly preferring the chaos that lets them forum-shop for the weakest regulations. 

### ⚡ Policy Quick Hits: Chip Diplomacy and Betting on Everything

🔄[ Trump Team Floats U-Turn on Nvidia China Ban](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-21/trump-team-internally-floats-idea-of-selling-nvidia-h200-chips-to-china)**:** Sources report internal discussions about allowing Nvidia H200 sales to China, which a potential reversal of export controls from both administrations. The H200 is already a generation behind Blackwell, so this is Trump's team testing how much they can give away. 

**🏛️**[ White House Tells Congress: Hands Off Our China Chip Ban](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/19/white-house-block-bill-restricting-ai-chip-exports)**:** Key officials are lobbying lawmakers to strip AI chip export restrictions from the defense bill, preferring executive control over legislative permanence. Translation: they want freedom to negotiate and selectively enforce without congressional guardrails. 

🎲[ Prediction Markets Cash In on Regulatory Green Light](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-20/kalshi-and-polymarket-battle-gambling-companies-in-prediction-market-frenzy)**:** Kalshi hit $1B weekly volume while Polymarket runs $464M, as both platforms race to scale during Trump-era regulatory opening. One plays by CFTC rules, the other builds around them, which is classic regulatory arbitrage. 

## 🏆 Google's Victory Lap: From AI Laggard to Leaderboard King

[Oriol Vinyals: The Secret Behind Gemini 3: Improving Pre-training & Post-training](https://x.com/OriolVinyalsML/status/1991568869165875581)

### 👑 Google Finally Takes the Crown

[Gemini 3 just surged ahead of OpenAI and every other competitor on benchmark tests](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-gemini-3-ai-behind-scenes-e1787729), marking the first time in years that Google decisively leads the AI race: 

  * **1,501 Elo Rating:** Highest score ever on the LMArena leaderboard, crushing GPT-5.1 on 19 out of 20 benchmarks 

  * **91.9% on GPQA Diamond:** Crushing Ph.D.-level reasoning tasks 

  * **23.4% on MathArena Apex:** A stunning jump from Gemini 2.5 Pro's 0.5% 

  * **50%+ More Coding Tasks Solved:** Outperforming even OpenAI's latest GPT models 

  * **1M Token Context:** Processing massive documents, images, and video in one session 




**Translation:** Google's custom TPU infrastructure gives Gemini 3 the speed and scale to operationalize these benchmark wins into real-world apps. This isn't just lab performance; it's production-ready dominance from the company that invented the transformer architecture. 

### 📈 Wall Street Picks Its Winner

[Alphabet's stock surged 6.9% on Wednesday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-19/alphabet-shares-soar-on-rave-reviews-for-new-gemini-ai-model), its biggest single-day gain since early September, before[ closing at a record high of $299.66](https://sherwood.news/tech/google-closes-at-a-record-high/): 

  * **55% Year-to-date Gain:** Google outpaced every major tech peer in 2025 




  * **$50B Annual Run Rate:** Google Cloud revenue, with AI driving acceleration 

  * **9 of 10 Top AI Labs:** Running as Google Cloud customers 




**Incredible Timing:** Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway just disclosed a new stake in Alphabet right as Gemini 3 dropped. 

**Why This Matters:** Google has something OpenAI and Anthropic can only dream about: distribution. Today, 9M devs are already building with Gemini, and the model is integrated across Search, Cloud, and consumer products, reaching billions of users instantly. 

**Reality Check:** A 7% pop on positive reviews is Wall Street saying "prove it." The real test comes when users actually choose Gemini 3 over ChatGPT, not when tech reviewers say nice things about benchmarks. 

### 🎯 Speed Demon With a Personality Transplant

[Matt Shumer's hands-on review](https://shumer.dev/gemini3review) reveals that Gemini 3's biggest upgrade isn't raw intelligence; it's that Google finally taught its AI to shut up and move fast: 

  * **Consistency:** Less "spiky" than predecessors, quality stays high instead of randomly faceplanting 

  * **Speed:** Real-time productivity without lag, even on complex reasoning 

  * **Personality:** Concise answers that respect your time (no more AI mansplaining) 

  * **Antigravity IDE:** A genuinely mature dev environment at launch 

  * **Catch** : Higher hallucination rates versus some competitors, though the UX is solid 




**The Reality** : The model crushes competitors in "intelligence per second" while delivering a terse, direct personality that skips the verbose preambles plaguing other models. Shumer describes it as working with a "skilled senior engineer": efficient and accurate, but still requiring verification for critical tasks. 

### 🚀 Scaling Laws Aren't Dead, Just Misunderstood

[Google's Gemini co-lead Oriol Vinyals threw cold water on the "scaling is dead" narrative](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-unseats-anthropic-gemini-3), crediting Gemini 3's breakthrough to better pre-training and post-training; the thing everyone declared was hitting a wall. 

**The Evidence:** Gemini 3 matches Gemini 2.5 at roughly 1T parameters, yet delivers what Vinyals calls the largest performance jump in Google's history.[ As Tomasz Tunguz notes](https://tomtunguz.com/gemini-3-proves-pretraining-scaling-laws-intact/), the virtuous cycle is confirmed: pre-training improvements, post-training advances, and inference optimization add up to compounding progress, not plateaus. 

**Translation:** Google didn't just scale bigger; they scaled smarter. While the rest of the industry was writing eulogies for pre-training, DeepMind was quietly proving there's still juice left in the fundamentals. 

### 🌍 Hassabis Reveals His Research Obsession: World Models

Google DeepMind's CEO [Demis Hassabis pulled back the curtain on Gemini 3](https://sources.news/p/demis-hassibas-on-gemini-3-world), describing the breakthrough as requiring "world-class research, world-class engineering, and world-class infra all working closely together:"

  * **2B people** use Search AI Overviews powered by Gemini monthly 

  * **650M Users** on the Gemini app itself 

  * **Entire Google Search index** being integrated into the model 




**Most Revealing Detail** : Hassabis shared that he personally spends his research time on world models. These AI systems build internal representations of reality for better planning and generalization. 

**Reality Check:** On the AI bubble question, Hassabis played it cagey, saying Google is "positioned strongly whether there's no bubble or there is one and there's some retrenchment." When your CEO hedges like that while cramming the internet's knowledge into one system, he's either being cautious or building something he knows might not survive economically.
