Good morning! This week, a 6-month-old startup with zero revenue raised $2B, burning cash faster than you generate it is a "growth strategy," and Congress actually passed crypto legislation. 

As we continue to build at [Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/), we've launched [Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/) with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter. 

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **Anthropic 's $100B fever dream:** Investors chase company with 9-figure offers despite burning $5.6B to make $4B. 

  * **Perplexity hits 120x revenue multiple:** Because apparently $150M revenue is worth $18B in 2025's AI casino. 

  * **Crypto finally gets rules:** Congress passes stablecoin regs, settles SEC vs CFTC cage match, tells Fed no CBDCs. 

  * **Thinking Machines Lab breaks reality:** Ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati raises $2B seed round at $10B valuation with zero product or revenue. 

  * **VC industry hits reality check:** AUM growing to $1.8T by 2029, but only 38% growth vs previous 100%, with 800+ aging unicorns and no exits. 




## 🤯 AI Valuations Gone Wild: When Revenue Multiples Enter the Stratosphere

### 🤖 Anthropic's $100B Moment: The Claude Effect

This week, Anthropic finds itself in an unusual position: [investors are chasing the company with $100B valuation offers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-16/anthropic-draws-investor-interest-at-more-than-100-billion-valuation), even though the AI startup isn't actively fundraising. Just months ago, they were valued at $61.5B. 

  * **The Numbers** : Revenue exploded from $3B to $4B annualized in just one month, with Claude Code alone generating $200M+. At $100B, they'd trade at 25x revenue, aggressive but more reasonable than OpenAI's 50x multiple. 

  * **The Catch?** They burned through $5.6B in 2024 while remaining unprofitable. User metrics are flattening despite strong enterprise adoption, and the talent wars with Meta and OpenAI threaten momentum. 

  * **Why the Frenzy?** Anthropic has positioned itself as the credible OpenAI alternative for enterprises. Their specialized products, such as Claude Code or Claude for Financial Services, demonstrate that they're targeting high-value verticals with premium pricing. 




Burning $5.6B to generate $4B in revenue isn't a business model. It's a bet that scale will eventually lead to profitability. And the fact that investors are approaching them, rather than Anthropic seeking funding, suggests the market has more capital than sense. 

### 🔍 Perplexity's $18B Reality Check: When Search Gets an AI Makeover

This week, [Perplexity AI raised another $100M, pushing its valuation to $18B](https://techfundingnews.com/perplexity-ai-18b-valuation-funding-comet-browser-launch/). However, here's the kicker: this wasn't even a new round, but rather an extension of their previous raise, as investors couldn't secure enough funding. 

  * **The Numbers** : Revenue rocketed from $35M to $150M annualized, while valuation soared from under $1B to $18B in less than two years. That's a 120x revenue multiple for those keeping score. 

  * **The Strategy** : Launched Comet, an AI-powered browser exclusive to premium subscribers, and inked a deal with Indian telecom giant Bharti Airtel, giving 360M+ users free Perplexity Pro for a year. 

  * **The Competition** : Taking on Google in search is like bringing a knife to a gunfight, but Perplexity's betting that citation-rich AI answers beat traditional blue links. 




At $150M in revenue and an $18B valuation, Perplexity is trading at multiples that make even Anthropic look reasonably priced. However, whether AI search is worth 120x revenue remains the billion-dollar question. 

## 🏛️ Crypto Week: Congress Finally Gives Digital Assets the Rulebook They've Been Begging For

### 💵 The Stablecoin Slam Dunk

[Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on July 18](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-signs-genius-act-into-law/), creating the first federal framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins. The highlights: 

  * **100% reserve requirement** backed by cash or short-term Treasuries (no more Tether-style "trust us, bro" accounting) 

  * **Monthly public disclosures** on what's actually backing your digital dollars 

  * **Consumer protections** that give holders priority if an issuer goes bust 

  * **Full AML/sanctions compliance** because Congress wants their cut of the action 




### 🎯 The Great Regulatory Turf War Gets Settled

[The CLARITY Act passed the House 294-134](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/06/bipartisan-majorities-in-two-house-committees-vote-to-advance-the-digital-asset-market-clarity-act-of-2025) and aims to finally answer the eternal question: Is it a security or a commodity? 

  * **CFTC gets the win** for most digital commodities, while SEC keeps investment contracts 

  * **Three-tier token taxonomy** lets tokens "mature" from securities to commodities once they're decentralized enough 

  * **Federal exchange registration** means no more state-by-state licensing hell for crypto exchanges 




### 🚫 The Anti-CBDC Middle Finger

[The House narrowly passed (219-217) the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act](https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2025-07-10_---_anti-cbdc_one-pager_final.pdf), basically telling the Fed to keep its hands off programmable money: 

  * **No retail CBDC** without explicit Congressional approval 

  * **Can 't use it for monetary policy**: sorry, negative interest rate dreams 

  * **Privacy protection** because nobody wants their coffee purchases being tracked 




After years of regulatory uncertainty, crypto finally gets adult supervision. Stablecoins gain legitimacy through strict rules, the industry receives clarity, consumers receive protection, and Congress gets to pretend it understands blockchain. 

But the real winner? Lawyers, who now have 500+ pages of new regulations to bill against. 

## ⚡ Startup Quick Hits

[Mira Murati, OpenAI - State of European Tech 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=xC48FEAZ5R4)

🤯****[Thinking Machines Lab's $2B Seed Shatters All Records](https://www.wired.com/story/thinking-machines-lab-mira-murati-funding/)**:** Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati's 6-month-old startup raised the largest seed round in history at a $10B pre-money valuation. Led by Andreessen Horowitz, with NVIDIA, Accel, ServiceNow, Cisco, AMD, Jane Street, and even Albania's government piling in. With no product or revenue yet, it's a pure bet on the team of ex-OpenAI talent building "collaborative general intelligence."

✨****[Lovable Hits Unicorn Status with "Vibe Coding"](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/lovable-becomes-a-unicorn-with-200m-series-a-just-8-months-after-launch/)**:** The Swedish AI startup raised $200M Series A at a $1.8B valuation just 8 months after launch, led by Accel. With 2.3M users, $75M ARR, and clients like Klarna and Hubspot, they're democratizing app creation for the "last 99%" who can't code. That's a ~24x revenue multiple for those counting. 

📝****[Substack Finally Joins the Unicorn Club](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/17/substack-newsletter-funding-creator-economy)**:** The newsletter platform raised $100M Series C at a $1.1B valuation, led by BOND and The Chernin Group. With 5M paid subscriptions and 50+ creators making $1M+ annually, they're betting on creator autonomy over algorithmic feeds. The 70% valuation jump from 2021 shows even boring businesses get AI-era multiples. 

## ⚡ VC Quick Hits

[Chainsmokers at Private ](https://linton.ai/bolt-new-just-threw-the-best-party-sf-has-seen-in-a-long-time-maybe-ever-but-it-was-a-lot-more-dd5f026a10fb)[Bolt.new](https://Bolt.new)[ Party from Morgan Linton](https://linton.ai/bolt-new-just-threw-the-best-party-sf-has-seen-in-a-long-time-maybe-ever-but-it-was-a-lot-more-dd5f026a10fb)

🎵****[The Chainsmokers Drop $100M Fund Like It's Hot](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/the-chainsmokers-mantis-ventures-closes-100m-third-fund/)**:** DJ duo's Mantis VC raised a $100M third fund, 25% larger than their last, while other VCs struggle to maintain fund sizes. They're skipping the typical celebrity VC playbook of consumer deals for B2B startups, leveraging their Fortune 500 party circuit connections for customer intros, because nothing says "enterprise sales" like EDM. 

**🎭**[Ex-Sequoia Partner Raises $355M After Failed Klarna Coup](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/former-sequoia-partner-matt-miller-raises-355m-for-new-fund-with-sequoias-backing/)**:** Matt Miller left Sequoia after trying (and failing) to oust Michael Moritz from Klarna's board, but still secured $355M for his new fund Evantic, with Sequoia as an LP. Despite the drama, he's targeting $400M total for B2B Series B/growth deals across the Atlantic, proving that in VC, there are no permanent enemies, only permanent carry. 

📈****[VC AUM to Hit $1.8T by 2029, But the Party's Slowing Down](https://view.mail.fortune.com/?qs=711ab63dc110a086dcbb0b18a4577bfbfdd80cf50b0372829317fa70c3cee5e18d0e6a8055a06ddde229c08e9b5ba8ff3f2c0f3a608c8d7437a0a09735e966645750088f17d55b67afa6b70f7bb01caa)**:** North American VC assets will grow 38% over five years to $1.8T, way slower than the previous five years when AUM doubled. After ballooning from 1,900 to 3,417 firms during ZIRP, the industry's now stuck with 800+ aging unicorns and no exits, turns out you can't eat paper gains.
