This week in Silicon Valley, Startups & Tech: 

  * **Big Short 2.0 Targets AI** : Michael Burry shorts NVIDIA & Palantir with $1B+ exposure, betting the AI bubble pops like subprime mortgages did in 2008 

  * **Thiel Dumps Nvidia Entirely** : Peter Thiel's fund unloads all 537,742 shares worth $100M in Q3, quietly exiting before telling anyone the party's over 

  * **Big Tech 's Climate Hypocrisy**: Microsoft, Amazon, Meta & Google's AI energy demands obliterate their 2040 carbon net-zero promises 

  * **AI IPO Boom Falls Flat** : 51 US tech IPOs raised $16.8B in 2025, driven by AI & crypto hype, but still 77% below 2021's 127 IPOs raising $74.4B 

  * **Space Data Centers Announced** : Musk, Bezos & Pichai discuss lunar and orbital AI facilities because it’s hard to build on Earth

## 🚪 The Great AI Exit: Smart Money's Quiet Escape

[Grace Blakeley: The AI Circular Economy](https://graceblakeley.substack.com/p/the-ai-circular-economy)

### 🎬 The Big Short 2.0: When Legendary Investors Dump AI

[Michael Burry, the investor who called the 2008 housing crash, has placed over $1.1B in put options against Nvidia and Palantir:](https://financialpost.com/financial-times/michael-burry-the-short-seller-bet-against-ai)

  * **$912M against Palantir:** Trading at 280x forward earnings 

  * **$187.6M against Nvidia:** Despite "only" a 20x P/E multiple 

  * **$9.3B in Insider Sales:** Nvidia and Palantir execs cashing out over two years 




Burry's timing is characteristically provocative as he’s betting that today's AI darlings are tomorrow's cautionary tales. His Q3 2025 disclosure sent the Nasdaq down 3% and reignited the "is AI a bubble?" debate. 

Meanwhile,[ Peter Thiel's hedge fund just dumped its entire Nvidia position](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-17/peter-thiel-s-fund-sold-off-entire-nvidia-stake-in-third-quarter), all 537,742 shares worth $100M, during Q3 2025. Thiel's Founders Fund turned early Facebook shares into a legendary win, and his Palantir bet on government AI was prescient years before ChatGPT made AI cool. 

Additionally, [at this week's Cerebral Valley AI Conference, 300+ founders and investors were asked which billion-dollar startup they'd short](https://www.businessinsider.com/at-an-ai-conference-attendees-were-asked-which-startup-they-would-short-2025-11). The winner? Perplexity, the AI search startup that is positioning itself as Google's replacement. OpenAI came in second. 

**Reality Check:** When company insiders are selling $9.3B worth of stock while retail investors pile in, and legendary contrarians like Burry and Thiel are exiting completely, someone may be getting the trade wrong. However, Nvidia seems to be the "safer" play than betting on AI companies themselves. 

### 💸 AI's IPO Victory Lap (Down 77% From Peak)

[AI and crypto companies dominated 2025's IPO winners, with 51 US tech IPOs raising $16.8B.](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ai-crypto-companies-dominated-ipo-winners-2025) Wall Street popped champagne because that's above the 3-year average, but let’s add context: 

  * **51 IPOs in 2025** vs. **127 IPOs in 2021** : that's a 60% decline in volume 

  * **$16.8B raised** vs. **$74.4B in 2021** : down 77% in actual capital 

  * **Above the 3-year Average** : we're finally less bad than the post-2021 crash years 




Yes, AI enthusiasm brought companies public but the venture ecosystem is still operating at a fraction of bubble-era capacity. 

**Reality Check:** When the hottest sector in tech, with literally every major corporation throwing billions at it, can only generate IPO activity 77% below recent peaks, that's not a bull signal. The "Big Short" thesis isn't that AI fails; it's that current valuations assume 2021-level exits are coming back. These numbers say otherwise. 

### 🏆 When AI Insiders Call BS on Their Own Industry

[Meta's Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun is reportedly leaving after being sidelined](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/yann-lecun-ai-meta-0058b13c), and he's not going quietly. The Turing Award winner, essentially the Nobel Prize of computing, says large language models are a "dead end" for achieving AGI. 

LeCun's exit follows Meta's $14B pivot to hire Alexandr Wang from Scale AI to lead a new "superintelligence" division focused on product-driven AI. Thus, Zuck is choosing to ship features over foundational research, sidelining LeCun's decade-long work on AI "world models” that actually understand cause and effect rather than just predict words. 

**The Bottom Line:** When a Turing Award winner walks away saying your entire technical approach is fundamentally broken, and your peers are literally betting against you, that's the AI equivalent of your own family shorting you in poker. 

## 🚀 When You Can't Build on Earth, Try Space

### ⚡ The 80 GW Fantasy: When AI Dreams Collide With Physics

[The WSJ just charted AI's collision with physics](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/when-ai-hype-meets-ai-reality-a-reckoning-in-6-charts-bf8043b4), revealing that US AI data center capacity has topped 80 GW in 2025: 

  * **$371B:** What Big Tech will spend on data centers in 2025 alone (up 44% YoY) 

  * **1 GW per Facility:** Single AI data centers consume enough power for 800K US homes 

  * **92 GW by 2027:** Global demand projection, if the grid can deliver it 




The industry is trying to build twice as much data center capacity as has been built since 2000, compressed into just five years. Power generation exists, but building transmission lines takes over a decade. Meanwhile, ROI concerns are mounting as Goldman Sachs notes analysts are "on heightened alert" for signs that monetization can't keep pace with buildout. 

Meanwhile,[ Big Tech's climate strategists are having a very bad year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-11-13/big-tech-s-climate-strategists-feel-strain-from-escalating-ai-power-demands). Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Google pledged to be net-zero carbon by 2040 or sooner. Then came the AI arms race: 

  * **10-30x More Power:** Generative AI vs. traditional AI workloads 

  * **10% of US Electricity:** Data centers' projected share by 2030 

  * **50% Emissions Increase:** Google's inconvenient truth since 2019 

  * **Three-Mile Island** : Microsoft is literally restarting this nuclear reactor. 




[Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski just went on record](https://www.ft.com/content/61ce397b-968c-403e-aecf-16d4b2ff08cd) saying he's "nervous about the size of these investments in these data centers." However, he personally owns stakes in OpenAI, Perplexity, and xAI, three companies that desperately need those massive data centers to exist. 

**Reality Check:** You can plan 80 GW of capacity, but you can't plan around physics. When your AI ambitions require 2% of global electricity and you're breaking your own climate pledges, the race isn't just about who builds the most compute, it's about who can actually turn it on. 

### 🎢 The Great Resistance: Even AI Bulls Are Getting Cold Feet

Meanwhile, locals are saying hell no.[ Local opposition blocked or delayed 17 US data center projects worth $98B in Q2 2025 alone](https://www.wired.com/story/the-data-center-resistance-has-arrived/), according to Data Center Watch, nearly double the previous ten months combined: 

  * **$98B blocked in 3 months** vs. **$64B in the prior 10 months**

  * **17 projects stalled in Q2 2025** , matching nearly a year's worth of resistance 

  * **Two-thirds** of targeted projects now face opposition or delays 




The resistance playbook is remarkably consistent: communities cite noise pollution, water consumption (AI training gulps it), power grid strain, and environmental impact. Tech giants assumed they could plant football-field-sized compute farms anywhere zoning allowed, and locals said, "not here, you won't."

**Reality Check:** The infrastructure land grab has gotten so massive that even its beneficiaries are publicly questioning the math. Every day of delay costs millions while AI companies print billion-dollar valuations on the promise of infinite compute. 

### 🚀 When Earth Runs Out of Real Estate, Launch GPUs Into Orbit

[When you've exhausted every desert, every fjord, and every nuclear plant parking lot, there's only one place left to build: space itself](https://www.wsj.com/tech/now-tech-moguls-want-to-build-data-centers-in-outer-space-a8d08b4b). Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Sundar Pichai have each discussed building lunar and orbital AI data centers, apparently because the great AI Infra Land Grab has gone interplanetary. 

**Translation:** When you're burning through data center capacity faster than you can build it, and every available power grid is tapped out, suddenly launching TPUs into orbit doesn't sound so crazy.
