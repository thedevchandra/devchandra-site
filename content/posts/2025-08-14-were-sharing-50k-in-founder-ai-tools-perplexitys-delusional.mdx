## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **Perplexity 's $34.5B Google Fantasy:** The $18B startup offered to buy Chrome worth $50-172B with "multiple large investors" who had no idea about it 

  * **Trump 's Chip Shakedown:** The president invented a 15% "tax" on Nvidia and AMD's China revenue in exchange for export licenses 

  * **China 's Paranoid Power Play:** Beijing ordered ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent to cancel 700K Nvidia chip orders over "security concerns"

  * **AMD 's Quiet $300B Revolution:** Lisa Su doubled data center revenue to $12.6B while capturing OpenAI, Meta, and both of Elon's companies as clients 

  * **Crypto 's "Told You So" Moment:** Bullish exchange IPOs at 89% pop to $10B valuation despite $348M losses, while Congress passes more crypto regulation 




## 🎭 Perplexity's $34.5B Chrome Play: Marketing Genius or Delusion?

Co-founders of Perplexity from Left to Right: Johnny Ho, Aravind Srinivas & Denis Yarats

### 🎪 The David vs Goliath Bid That Broke the Internet

[Perplexity just offered $34.5B to buy Google's Chrome browser](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/perplexity-offers-to-buy-chrome-for-billions-more-than-its-raised/), despite being valued at only $18B itself. Here’s the audacious details: 

  * **The Math Problem:** Perplexity had $850M in the bank as of December, but claims "multiple large investors" would fund the full $34.5B 

  * **Project Solomon:** The internal codename for this moonshot, complete with nonbinding term sheets and promises to invest $3B over two years 

  * **The Pinky Promise:** They'd keep Google as Chrome's default search and maintain Chromium for "at least 100 months post-close"

  * **Reality Check:** Chrome is estimated to be worth $50B minimum, with some calculations putting it at $172-630B based on Safari economics 




**The Kicker:** Even Perplexity's own investors are scratching their heads as several of them have said they haven't even been briefed on this Chrome deal. 

### 🎯 The Real Game: Perplexity's Browser Shopping Spree

Before this Chrome spectacle, [Perplexity was already playing browser speed-dating](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/wild-chrome-bid-perplexity-hunting-browsers) with everyone who'd take their calls: 

  * **The Browser Co. (Dec ‘24):** Discussed acquisition but got nowhere; OpenAI got further, even discussing price, but no dice 

  * **Brave (Summer ‘25):** Offered ~$1B mostly in stock for the privacy-focused browser but got "thanks but no thanks" to being lowballed 

  * **DuckDuckGo:** CEO meetup arranged by mutual investors; Perplexity pitched their browser dreams, DuckDuckGo listened politely 

  * **The Haul So Far:** Acquired Sidekick (distraction-free browser), Carbon (LLM data connector), and Invisible (AI agent infrastructure) 




**Why It Matters:** CEO Aravind Srinivas told investors Perplexity needs a "popular browser offering" to win AI search. Browsers provide crucial context (open tabs, browsing history, user behavior) that makes AI search actually useful. 

### 📊 Chrome Math: Why $34.5B is Either Genius or Insulting

[Tomasz Tunguz: What is Chrome Worth?](https://tomtunguz.com/chrome-valuation-safari-comparison/)

[Thomas Tunguz provides real numbers](https://tomtunguz.com/chrome-valuation-safari-comparison/) about what Chrome is actually worth: 

  * **The Safari Benchmark:** Google pays Apple $18-20B annually for default search on 850M Safari users = $21 per user/year 

  * **Chrome 's 3.5B Users:** At Safari rates, that's $73B in annual revenue potential 

  * **Perplexity 's Offer:** Values Chrome at just $9 per user/year (less than half Safari's rate) 

  * **Real Valuation Range:** At standard 5-6x revenue multiples, Chrome is worth $367-441B minimum 




**The Strategic Play:** If Google is forced to divest, it'd likely pay the buyer of Chrome the same $73B+ annually to be the default search. That makes the browser a golden goose worth protecting at almost any price. 

### 🎪 The Marketing Masterstroke (That Everyone Sees Through)

This isn't [Perplexity's first rodeo with impossible acquisitions](https://spyglass.org/i-offer-to-buy-jupiter/): 

  * **Jan ‘25:** Offered to buy TikTok's US operations (that went nowhere) 

  * **Pattern Recognition:** Make splashy offer for thing that's not for sale → generate headlines → raise money at higher valuation 

  * **Mission Accomplished:** More press in 3 days than the previous 3 weeks, plus news of a fresh funding round at $20B valuation 




**The Legal Angle:** Bloomberg's [Dave Lee suggests Perplexity is trying to influence Judge Amit Mehta](https://spyglass.org/i-offer-to-buy-jupiter/) by proving Chrome could thrive outside Google, poking holes in Google's defense that Chrome needs to stay in-house for Chromium's health. 

**Bottom Line:** As M.G. Siegler put it, this is "clearly a marketing stunt." But it's a brilliant one as Perplexity keeps positioning itself as the plucky AI underdog willing to take on Big Tech, even if the math doesn’t add up. 

## 💻 The Silicon Showdown: How Chips Are the New Oil

### 💰 Trump's 15% Chip Tax: Making Nvidia Pay to Play in China

The dealmaker-in-chief just invented pay-to-export foreign policy. [Nvidia and AMD agreed to fork over 15% of their China chip revenue](https://www.wsj.com/tech/nvidia-amd-chip-sales-us-government-f9e34b5f) to the US Govt in exchange for export licenses: 

  * **The Cut:** 15% of revenue from Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips (Trump wanted 20%) 

  * **The Tease:** Trump might allow "somewhat enhanced-in a negative way" Blackwell chips (30-50% performance cut) 

  * **The Math:** Billions in quarterly revenue = hundreds of millions in questionable "taxes"




**The Play** : Jensen Huang reportedly dangled a $500B US investment and worked to develop a bromance with Trump. As the president put it: "Listen, I want 20% if I'm going to approve this for you, for the country."

### 🇨🇳 China Says "Thanks But No Thanks" to Nvidia's Chips

Just weeks after Trump's deal, [China’s Cyberspace Administration ordered ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent to suspend all Nvidia purchases](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/china-demands-companies-halt-nvidia-chip-orders-security-concerns), citing "security concerns."

  * **The Result** : Chinese firms had just ordered 700K H20 chips after Trump's reversal 

  * **CAC Fears Backdoors** : Speculating that there are US location trackers in chips 

  * **China Knows Huang 's game**: Keep Chinese innovation dependent on US tech 




The paranoia is real, but trust is a luxury nobody can afford in the chip wars. 

### 🚀 Lisa Su's Quiet Revolution: How AMD Became the AI Alternative

[YouTube (All-In Podcast): Winning the AI Race Part 3: Jensen Huang, Lisa Su](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WkGNe27r_Q)

While Jensen gets headlines, [AMD CEO Lisa Su methodically built the anti-Nvidia](https://www.wired.com/story/lisa-su-runs-amd-and-is-out-for-nvidias-blood/) with a 10-year turnaround from $2B to nearly $300B market cap. 

  * **The Revenue:** Doubled data center to $12.6B in two years 

  * **The Clients:** OpenAI, Meta, Google, plus both of Elon's companies 

  * **Reality Check:** Under 15% AI chip market share as AMD's software still makes developers cry compared to CUDA 

  * **The Philosophy:** Rejected nine-figure comp packages ("It's not really about one person") 




**The Family Secret:** Su and Jensen Huang are distant cousins, which she finds annoying when asked. Her secret weapon is patience: "I'm not impatient with this. Just give me a shot."

### 🎯 Everyone's Coming for Nvidia's Crown (Good Luck With That)

[Nvidia controls 80%+ of the AI chip market](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-competitors) thanks to 16 years of building CUDA while losing money. And here are the other challengers who want a share of that $500B+ pie: 

  * **Hyperscalers:** Google's TPUs and Amazon's Trainium offer cheaper alternatives; the custom chip market is expected to double in 2025 

  * **Intel:** Once America's chip darling, now desperately relevant with Gaudi chips and a new CEO 

  * **Huawei:** Jensen's "single most formidable" Chinese nightmare that export restrictions only made hungrier 

  * **Startups:** Cerebras, Groq, Rivos, and others are burning VC cash searching for the one weird trick Nvidia hates 




**The Reality:** When your competition spent 16 years building an unassailable moat, good luck catching up with a Series B and a dream. 

## ⚡ Quick Hits: When Desperation Meets AI Innovation

[YouTube (CNBC): Bullish CEO Tom Farley: The institutional wave in crypto has begun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T3thNidVyE)

  * 📈****[Bullish's 89% IPO Pop Makes Everyone Bullish on Crypto](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/bullish-pops-89-on-first-day-of-trading-riding-crypto-hype)**:** The Cayman Islands crypto exchange soared from $37 to $70 on its NYSE debut, hitting a $10B valuation despite posting a $348M Q1 loss. They allocated 20% to retail investors to avoid "another Figma situation" but still mooned anyway, proving that vibes are everything. 

  * **🏛️**[The CLARITY Act: Congress Actually Doing Its Job](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/genius-act-clarity-act-crypto-legislation-explained/)**:** The House just passed the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (294-134 with 78 Dems). Potentially the most important crypto law ever, it promises to end years of regulatory uncertainty that's kept crypto in legal limbo, with supporters comparing it to the Securities Act of 1933. 

  * **💰**[Trump's Crypto 401(k) Executive Order](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/trump-signs-debanking-crypto-401-k-executive-orders)**:** Trump signed orders letting 401(k)s invest in crypto and private equity while also banning "debanking" for political beliefs (his family is suing Capital One for closing their accounts post-Jan 6). Critics worry your retirement is going to get riskier, while crypto bros celebrate.

## 💭 Parting Thoughts

The tech industry has entered its "fake it till you make it" final boss level, where $18B companies bid on $50B assets with IOUs, and presidents negotiate chip export licenses like they're selling timeshares. But maybe that's the perfect metaphor for 2025: in a world where memes move markets and marketing stunts masquerade as M&A;, the only currency that matters is audacity.
