Figma just rocketed 250% on day one and made Adobe's failed $20B acquisition offer look like pocket change. 

Meanwhile, OpenAI and Anthropic are inhaling capital faster than a tech bro founder at an all-you-can-eat buffet, collectively raising over $11B while burning through cash at a rate that would make WeWork blush. 

###### As we continue to build at [Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/), we've launched [Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/) with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter.

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * ​​**Figma 's IPO shattered records:** 250% first-day pop to $67B valuation, proving the IPO window isn't just open, it's been blown off its hinges 

  * **AI giants are money-printing machines:** OpenAI hit $12B revenue run rate; Anthropic at $5B and raising at $170B valuation 

  * **The talent wars are brutal:** Meta keeps poaching Google researchers and now Apple AI experts in the past few weeks; entry-level jobs are vanishing 

  * **Sports leagues turned VCs:** From NBA Equity to Utah Jazz owner's $1B fund, athletes and leagues are the new startup kingmakers

## 🎨 Figma's Record-Breaking IPO Debut

[The Information: Figma IPO Set to Be a Windfall for Silicon Valley’s Biggest Names](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/figma-ipo-set-windfall-silicon-valleys-biggest-names?utm_source=grant.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=ai-is-eating-software&_bhlid=5102290be320f494549b7475bd0cf6656b610116)

📈****[Design Platform Soars 250% on First Trading Day](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/figma-fig-starts-trading-on-nyse-after-ipo.html?utm_source=grant.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=saas-is-back-and-bigger-than-ever)**:** Figma just pulled off the IPO of the year, with shares exploding from $33 to $115.50 on Thursday. It’s a 250% first-day pop that gave it a $67.7B valuation. With only 8% of shares available and $44.9M in Q1 profits (on $228M revenue, up 46% YoY), the design platform proved the IPO window is wide open. 

💔****[Failed Adobe Deal Becomes $67B Victory Lap](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/technology/figma-ipo.html?utm_source=grant.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=saas-is-back-and-bigger-than-ever)**:** Remember when Adobe tried to buy Figma for $20B in 2022? European regulators killed the deal, leaving Figma with a $1B breakup fee and bruised ego. Now, Figma's now worth 3x that offer, and CEO Dylan Field (33) kept 74% voting control despite owning just 9% of shares. 

**💰**[Early VCs Hit the Venture Capital Lottery](https://view.mail.fortune.com/?qs=6a254c0bc1adb43b6b9f6b687b907ac11b5d191c69a37d205db6af2b9539d54cd77c87743926e5f3df7ddd8fe0c6684127887a0e39da1b9bba8040435c79fc0b841015a8fdaee0adada70cdd08c82e12)**:** Index Ventures' Danny Rimer backed 19-year-old dropout Dylan Field in 2013 with a $1.8M Seed, investing $86.5M total over 12 years. The payoff was a stake worth $7B+, nearly 90x their investment. Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia are also sitting on billion-dollar positions. 

🚀****[IPO Pipeline Ready to Burst](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/figma-ipo-filing-defies-economic-gloom)**:** Figma's moonshot could trigger an IPO avalanche. With 119 offerings year-to-date (up 45%), companies like Databricks, Canva, and Netskope are warming up. The recipe for success are its blue-chip clients (Netflix, Uber, Duolingo), AI integration that actually works, and fundamentals that don't require creative accounting. 

## 🤖 AI Giants Race to Gobble Up Billions

[Sam Altman | This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von #599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYn8VKW6vXA&_bhlid=345dede2ad1bfa3cd97f5c7c132831db2dc42a7b)

**💰**[OpenAI's Oversubscribed $8.3B Round](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/01/business/dealbook/openai-ai-mega-funding-deal.html)**:** OpenAI raised $8.3B at a $300B valuation in a round that was 5x oversubscribed. Dragoneer dropped a casual $2.8B check while Blackstone, TPG, and T. Rowe Price joined the party. Early investors are salty about reduced allocations as OpenAI brought in new friends. The cash is going straight to Stargate, their mega data center project with SoftBank, Oracle, and NVIDIA. 

📈****[OpenAI Doubles Revenue to $12B While Burning Cash](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-hits-12-billion-annualized-revenue-breaks-700-million-chatgpt-weekly-active-users)**:** OpenAI's annualized revenue run rate hit $12B (some say $13B) after just seven months of 2025. ChatGPT crossed 700M weekly users while cash burn climbed to $8B annually. They're crushing Anthropic's $4-5B revenue, but that burn rate is giving WeWork flashbacks. 

🚀****[Anthropic Triples Valuation to $170B in 5 Months](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-29/anthropic-nears-deal-to-raise-funding-at-170-billion-valuation)**:** Anthropic's raising $3-5B at a $170B valuation, nearly 3x its $61.5B price tag from March. Iconiq Capital's leading, while sovereign wealth funds (Qatar, Singapore's GIC) and possibly Amazon circle like sharks. Revenue has hit a $5B run rate, and at $170B, Anthropic proves it's the clear #2 in the AI race. 

**The Bottom Line:** Together, these two giants are generating $18B in combined revenue, which is proof that the AI gold rush is very, very real as VCs throw money like it's 2021 again. 

## ⚡ Startup Quick Hits: Ramp, Anaconda, and more!

[Meet Ramp: A smart finance operations platform that saves you time and money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yazRO0jRTag)

With $700M in annualized revenue and 40,000+ businesses on board, Ramp's AI agents are now catching expense policy violations fast. 

🐍****[Anaconda Raises $150M at $1.5B Valuation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-31/ai-startup-anaconda-hits-1-5-billion-valuation-in-new-round)**:** The Python platform beloved by data scientists raised its Series C from Insight Partners and Mubadala, jumping from $222M to $1.5B valuation since 2021. With 21 billion downloads and 95% of Fortune 500 companies using their tools, Anaconda is basically the infrastructure layer for enterprise AI development that nobody talks about but everyone uses. 

**🛍️**[Klarna Eyes September IPO as Fintech Stocks Heat Up](https://news.sky.com/story/klarna-prepares-for-autumn-bid-to-revive-15bn-new-york-float-13404537)**:** The Swedish buy-now-pay-later giant is reportedly reviving its NYSE IPO plans after pausing in April due to Trump's tariff tantrum. Originally seeking $1B+ at a $15B+ valuation, Klarna's timing might be perfect as fellow Affirm's stock has nearly doubled from April lows, and recent fintech IPO Chime is up 25% since debut. 

## ⚡ Investor Quick Hits: From Startup Monasteries to Sports League VCs

[HF0 Residency: The Program for Repeat Founders](https://www.hf0.com/?_bhlid=5bf92c6f5e0b38e1c4004ffb4395df918ff0d884)

🚀****[The New Up-and-Coming Startup Accelerators](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/best-new-startup-accelerators)**:** A new crop of accelerators is reshaping how early-stage founders find funding, mentorship, and in some cases, monastic seclusion. The very first startup accelerators appeared about two decades ago—a wave led most prominently by Y Combinator. Now Alex Perry highlights the ones that have risen to prominence in the last five years, including Sequoia Arc, a16z's Speedrun, and even Dave Fontenot's HF0. 

🤖****[GV Backs AI Rivals to Its Own Parent Company](https://news.crunchbase.com/ai/venture-goog-munichiello-hulme-gv/)**:** Google Ventures (GV) isn't playing it safe by investing in startups that directly compete with Google products. Managing partners Dave Munichiello and Tom Hulme backed Thinking Machines Lab’s Seed at a $12B valuation, led Harvey's Series C at $1.5B (now worth $5B), and co-led OpenEvidence at $3.5B. As Munichiello puts it: "Amazing companies sometimes are at prices that feel very uncomfortable."

🏀****[Sports Leagues Turn Into VCs with "Chummy" Style](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sports-leagues-hunt-startup-investments-chummy-style-venture-capital)**:** Flush with record broadcast deals, leagues from the NBA to MLS are acting like venture firms and funding startups that boost fan experience and tech innovation. Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith just launched a $1B fund (HXCO) targeting sports-tech, while NBA Equity backs AI analytics startups. Recent deals include League One Volleyball's $100M raise and Angel City FC's $123M round. 

## 💼 Personnel Quick Hits: Playing Musical Chairs with Seven-Figure Salaries

🧠****[Google's New AI Czar Has One Job](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-new-ai-architect-plans-spread-gemini-everywhere)**:** Google gave Koray Kavukcuoglu (former missile engineer) the role of AI Chief Architect with a simple mandate: embed Gemini into every single Google product. He's already yanked 200 engineers from search and reports, directly reporting to Sundar, all while an antitrust ruling next month could force Google to divest Chrome. 

🍎****[Meta's AI Talent Heist: Apple Edition](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-07-30/apple-loses-fourth-ai-researcher-in-a-month-to-metas-superintelligence-team)**:** Meta's superintelligence team just snagged its fourth Apple AI researcher, multimodal expert Bowen Zhang, as part of a hiring spree that's decimating Apple Intelligence plans. Zuckerberg's strategy is simple: show up with blank checks that make even Apple's packages look cute, then promise researchers they can build AGI. 

📉****[Entry-Level Jobs Are Getting Taken by AI](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/ai-entry-level-jobs-graduates-b224d624)**:** While tech giants throw millions at senior AI researchers, they're using that same AI to eliminate entry-level positions that would train the next generation. College grads are discovering their dream jobs automated away before graduation, with white-collar career ladders missing their bottom rungs. 

📊****[Trump Fires BLS Chief Over "Rigged" Jobs Numbers](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/01/jobs-report-july-unemployment)**:** President Trump just pulled the first jobs-data-related firing in nearly a century, axing the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief after weak July numbers, which signals a warning for the economy. His supposed claim: "Today's Jobs Numbers were RIGGED to make Republicans, and ME, look bad."
