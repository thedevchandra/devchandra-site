This week, tech giants decided that building Manhattan-sized data centers and actual power plants is totally normal business strategy, while robotaxis proved they still can't handle a light drizzle without adult supervision. 

From Meta's $72B infrastructure bet to Tesla's $4.20 "autonomous" rides that require three babysitters, the gap between AI ambition and reality has never been more expensive or entertaining. 

###### As we continue to build at [Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/), we've launched [Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/) with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter.

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **Meta 's Going Full SimCity:** Zuck's building Manhattan-sized data centers, spending $72B this year alone to win the AI race 

  * **Pennsylvania is the New Silicon Valley:** $90B+ in AI infrastructure commitments, as you can't run superintelligence without actual power 

  * **China 's Robotaxis Just Went Global:** Uber partnered with Baidu to deploy thousands of autonomous vehicles across Asia & the Middle East 

  * **Waymo 's Math Doesn't Math:** They hit 100M autonomous mile,s but trips have plateaued as they may not be serving more users 

  * **Tesla 's "Autonomous" Cars Need Three Babysitters:** Six months late, Tesla's Austin robotaxis launched with much supervision 




## 🔌 The New Gold Rush: Why Tech Giants Are Building Power Plants to Feed Their AI Dreams

### 🔥 Meta's Manhattan-Sized Bet on Superintelligence

Mark Zuckerberg just went full Tony Stark, announcing [Meta will build multiple data centers the size of Manhattan](https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DMF6uUgx9f9) in a move that makes other tech giants' AI investments look like pocket change. 

The scale is absolutely bonkers: 

  * **Prometheus** (Ohio, 2026): Meta's first 1GW+ supercluster 

  * **Hyperion** (Louisiana): Scaling to **5GW** or enough to power a million homes 

  * **Price Tag** : "Hundreds of billions" with $72B capex this year alone 




**Going Giga** : SemiAnalysis confirms [Meta's on track to be the first lab with a gigawatt-scale facility](https://semianalysis.com/2025/07/11/meta-superintelligence-leadership-compute-talent-and-data/). For context, most data centers measure in megawatts. This is like going from a Toyota Corolla to a rocket ship. 

**The Strategy** : After getting embarrassed by GPT-4, Zuck is promising "industry-leading compute per researcher" at Meta Superintelligence Labs. Thus, if you can't out-innovate them, out-spend them. 

### ⚡ The AI Gold Rush Just Hit Pennsylvania Coal Country

Meta is not alone. [Blackstone just dropped $25B to turn Pennsylvania into AI's power plant](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/blackstone-ai-data-centers-energy-pennsylvania), building data centers and the natural gas facilities to feed them. 

Here’s the Pennsylvania pile-on: 

  * **Blackstone** : $25B for data centers + power plants (colocation strategy) 

  * **Google** : $25B+ across the Mid-Atlantic 

  * **CoreWeave** : $6B Lancaster data center 

  * **Total** : $90B+ announced (more than most countries' GDP) 




**The Real Play** : While everyone fights over GPUs, Blackstone is solving the actual bottleneck of power. Pennsylvania produces 20% of America's natural gas, and you can't run AI on vibes alone. 

**The Irony** : The Rust Belt that lost manufacturing to China is now ground zero for America's AI infrastructure arms race against... China. Sometimes history doesn't repeat, it remixes. 

## 🎭 The Self-Driving Circus: International Expansion, Growing Pains, and Human Babysitters

### 🤝 The Alliance That Makes Tesla Look Like a Science Fair Project

While Elon's robotaxis are learning to navigate Austin, [Uber just teamed up with China's Baidu](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/uber-taps-china-s-baidu-for-robotaxis-in-asia-middle-east) to drop thousands of autonomous vehicles across Asia and the Middle East. 

The partnership details are mind-blowing: 

  * **Apollo Go 's Track Record**: 11M+ rides completed across 15 Chinese cities (that's more than Waymo globally) 

  * **The Rollout** : Thousands of robotaxis launching this year in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and beyond 

  * **The Strategy** : Uber provides the platform, Baidu brings the proven tech 




**Why This Matters** : Baidu's Apollo Go isn't some startup burning VC cash. They're already operating at scale in the world's most chaotic traffic environments. If you can navigate Beijing rush hour autonomously, Dubai is basically easy mode. 

The geopolitical angle is fascinating too. While the US wrings its hands about Chinese tech, Uber is essentially saying, "forget the politics, let's make money," as they’ve already partnered with Waymo, WeRide, and Avride. 

### 🤔 Waymo Hit 100M Miles But Forgot to Mention Something Important

Waymo dropped a celebratory press release Tuesday: [100M fully autonomous miles completed!](https://www.inc.com/reuters/waymo-just-crossed-100-million-miles-of-driverless-rides-meanwhile-tesla-has-started-small/91213739) Pop the champagne! Except... something doesn't add up. 

The weird math: 

  * **February** : 200,000+ trips per week (per Sundar Pichai) 

  * **April** : 250,000+ trips per week (5x growth from the previous year!) 

  * **Today** : Still... 250,000+ trips per week? 




**The Reality Check** : Waymo's miles are exploding (10x in two months!, but actual rides have plateaued. It seems they're driving longer distances in sprawling cities like LA, not necessarily serving more customers. 

For context, Lyft does **18.2M rides per week** , so Waymo's 250k looks less impressive when you realize they're in five major cities and growing... nowhere fast. 

### 👶 Tesla's Robotaxi Needs Adult Supervision (Literally)

Six months after Musk promised "unsupervised full self-driving" in Austin by June, [Tesla's robotaxis are finally on the road](https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-why-teslas-robotaxi-launch-needed-human-babysitters/). With supervision. Lots of it. 

**The "Autonomous" Setup**: 

  * Safety monitor in the front passenger seat (ready to grab the wheel) 

  * Remote operators monitoring/controlling from afar 

  * Service suspended during rain (because Texas never has bad weather?) 

  * Price: $4.20 per ride (yes, it's a weed joke) 




**The Early Reviews** : Tesla influencers with financial stakes in the company love it! But their own videos show less-than-smooth rides: phantom braking, crossing double yellow lines, and safety monitors intervening to avoid UPS trucks. 

**The Sensor Debate Rages On** : While every other robotaxi company uses lidar + radar + cameras, Tesla insists cameras alone are enough. As Cummings notes: "There is no robotic system that is safety critical that has ever been successful on a single sensor strain."

While Baidu's completing millions of rides in Chinese megacities and Waymo's cruising through LA, Tesla can't handle Austin drizzle without human help.

### 💭 Parting Thoughts

The AI industry is simultaneously building cities to house their digital brains while struggling to navigate actual cities with their robot cars. 

Maybe that's the perfect metaphor for 2025: we're so focused on building the infrastructure for superintelligence that we forgot to make sure regular intelligence can handle a rainy Tuesday in Austin.
