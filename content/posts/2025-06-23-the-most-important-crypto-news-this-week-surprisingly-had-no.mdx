If the funding landscape feels completely unhinged right now, you're not alone: $2B seed rounds and AI acquihires will do that. 

As we continue to build at **[Context Ventures](http://contextvc.com)** , we've launched **[Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/)** with a simple mission: **to****help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter.**

Because in a world where ex-OpenAI resumes command billions and stablecoins suddenly have Congressional approval, you need every edge you can get. 

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **Crypto Goes Corporate:** Senate passes stablecoin laws, JPMorgan launches token, Shopify accepts crypto payments 

  * **$2B for PowerPoint:** Ex-OpenAI CTO raises record seed round for startup with zero revenue 

  * **Talent Wars:** Tech giants pay billions to acquire entire AI teams instead of hiring 

  * **SEO is Dead:** Startup raises $20M to help brands optimize for AI search engines 

  * **Back Office Billions:** Private equity software company becomes $1.1B unicorn with AI platform 

  * **Solo Success:** Developer sells 6-month side project to Wix for $80M cash 




## 🏛️ Congress Just Made Crypto Boring (And That's Huge)

Yes, BTC is hovering over $100K. But the big news is that the [Senate passing the GENIUS Act ](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/genius-stablecoin-bill-crypto.html)with a 68-30 bipartisan vote, creating the first federal framework for stablecoins: 

  * **The Regulatory Breakthrough:** Stablecoin issuers must now back tokens 100% with segregated funds (no more Celsius-style shenanigans), and there's a $10B threshold where federal oversight kicks in. Big Tech companies need unanimous approval from Treasury, Fed, and FDIC chairs to issue stablecoins. 

  * **The Corporate Stampede:** Within days, JPMorgan announced JPMD, their institutional deposit token launching on Coinbase's blockchain. Shopify has partnered with Stripe and Coinbase to let millions of merchants accept USDC payments across 34 countries. Even Walmart and Amazon are reportedly exploring their own stablecoins. 

  * **The Numbers:** Stablecoin market cap hit a record $251.7B, up 22% this year. Stripe has processed $94B in stablecoin payments over two years, with monthly volumes growing from under $2B to over $6.3B. 




While everyone argued about Bitcoin, stablecoins quietly became the bridge between traditional finance and crypto. Now, regulatory clarity has just turned stablecoins from crypto experiments into legitimate financial infrastructure, so the "Wild West" phase may be officially over. 

## 🚀 The $2B "Seed" Round: When Your Startup Raises More Than Most Countries' GDP

_Screenshot from the_ _[Thinking Machines Lab website](https://thinkingmachines.ai/)_

Mira Murati's [Thinking Machines Lab just closed a $2B Seed at a $10B valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/mira-muratis-thinking-machines-lab-closes-on-2b-at-10b-valuation/). The company is six months old, with no product, no revenue, and a website that says, "we're building cool AI stuff, trust us."

  * **The Resume that Broke Silicon Valley:** Murati was OpenAI's former CTO who led the development of ChatGPT, DALL-E, and voice mode before leaving in September. She also briefly served as interim CEO when Sam Altman got the temporary boot. 

  * **The Dream Team:** Several former OpenAI colleagues have joined, including co-founder John Schulman, as well as other AI rockstars like Bob McGrew and Alec Radford. 

  * **The Funding Frenzy:** A16z led the round with participation from Sarah Guo's Conviction Partners. This could be the largest seed round in history, which is saying something in an era where "seed" rounds have grown from $50M in 2015 to $200M today. 

  * **What They 're Building:** Nobody really knows! The company's goal is to make AI systems "more widely understood, customizable and generally capable," which just means "we'll figure it out as we go."




In today's AI market, having "ex-OpenAI" on your LinkedIn is apparently worth more than most Fortune 500 companies. 

## 🤖 The Great AI Talent Grab: When Big Tech Pays Billions Just to Poach Your Team

_Photo by_ _[Tomasz Tunguz](https://tomtunguz.com/the-coming-wave-of-acquihires/)_

Recently, [Tomasz Tunguz detailed the rise and popularity of "acquihires."](https://tomtunguz.com/the-coming-wave-of-acquihires/) It’s where companies buy entire startups just to poach their teams. 

  * **The Recent Example:** Meta just paid **$14.8B** to get Scale AI's CEO Alexandr Wang and his team. The company? Mostly irrelevant. The talent? Priceless. Wang now runs Meta's new "superintelligence" lab. 

  * **Other Tech Giants** : Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are doing the same, getting entire AI teams for billions. Google paid $2.7B for [Character.AI](https://Character.AI)'s founders, plus 30 engineers. 

  * **Why the Frenzy?** Finding good AI talent is hard, and with Seed-to-Series A funding down 86%, struggling AI startups make perfect targets. Instead of the painful process of hiring, tech giants just buy pre-assembled teams. 

  * **The Deal Structure:** Companies avoid merger reviews by "licensing technology" and "hiring teams,” not technically buying the whole company. About 70% of the deal goes to employees as golden handcuffs, while early investors get scraps. 




In the AI gold rush, the real gold isn't just the tech. It's the people who understand it, and tech giants will pay a lot to make sure those people work for them, not the competition. 

## 🔍 The Death of SEO: How AI Just Killed a $68B Industry

_Screenshot from_ _[Profound’s X Post](https://x.com/tryprofound/status/1886472676878823814)_

Remember when "SEO" was hot in marketing? Well, maybe not anymore as [Profound just raised $20M Series A](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/13/move-over-seo-profound-is-helping-brands-with-ai-search-optimization/) from Kleiner Perkins to pioneer "Answer Engine Optimization."

  * **The Shift:** When asking ChatGPT, "What's the best project management tool?", you get a direct answer, not a list of links like that from Google Search. So the goal is to get AI to mention your brand or product in its response. 

  * **What Profound Does:** They track how brands appear across the AI platforms by processing 100+ million AI queries monthly. Early clients, such as Indeed and MongoDB, are seeing a 25-40% improvement in AI visibility within 60 days. 

  * **The Investor Lineup:** Kleiner Perkins led, with Khosla Ventures, NVIDIA Ventures, and angels like Guillermo Rauch (Vercel's CEO) joining. 




The future of marketing isn't ranking #1 on Google anymore. It's being the answer AI gives when millions ask AI questions. 

## 💼 The $1.1B Back Office: How Boring Software Just Became Unicorn Territory

_Photo from_ _[Juniper Square Insights post](https://www.junipersquare.com/videos/make-better-decisions-with-data-driven-insights)_

Juniper Square just quietly became a $1.1B unicorn by solving the world's most expensive paperwork problem. The company raised [$130M Series D from Ribbit Capital](https://www.fintechfutures.com/venture-capital-funding/juniper-square-hits-1-1bn-valuation-with-130m-series-d) to supercharge "JunieAI," their AI platform for PE and VC firms: 

  * **The Unsexy Reality:** Private markets manage over $1T in capital, but still run on Excel spreadsheets and email chains. When you're handling pension funds and sovereign wealth money, "move fast and break things" isn't really an option. 

  * **What Juniper Square Does:** They're the operating system for 2,000+ private market firms managing 40,000+ funds. Plus, JunieAI automates the mind-numbing stuff, including investor updates, fund administration, and portfolio reporting. 

  * **Why It Matters:** Private markets are projected to hit $60T in the next decade. When the industry manages more money than most countries' GDP needs, better software, investors pay attention. 




While AI startups chase consumer apps, the real money is in automating industries where mistakes cost millions. Sometimes, the most boring businesses make the best unicorns. 

## 💰 The $80M Side Project: How One Developer Shows a "Solo Unicorn" is Possible

_Screenshot from_ _[Maor Shlomo’s X Post](https://x.com/MS_BASE44/status/1935329969078444263?_bhlid=aace5b3eeaac0eb26e038019e5146e6a79a0f284)_

Meet Maor Shlomo, the 31-year-old developer who just [sold his 6-month-old "side project," Base44, to Wix for $80M cash.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/6-month-old-solo-owned-vibe-coder-base44-sells-to-wix-for-80m-cash/)

  * **The Numbers:** 10k users in three weeks, 250k users in six months, and $189,000 profit in May alone. All bootstrapped. 

  * **What It Does:** "Vibe coding" platform where you type what you want, and AI builds complete applications. 

  * **The Growth Hack:** Shlomo just posted about building it on LinkedIn and Twitter. That's it. No marketing budget, just a developer documenting his journey. 




One person with good taste and AI tools built something worth $80M in half a year. The "solo unicorn" might still be mythical, but Shlomo just proved it's not impossible.
