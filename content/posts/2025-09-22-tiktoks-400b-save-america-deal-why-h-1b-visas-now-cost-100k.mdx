If you thought the govt buying Intel equity was peak 2025, wait until you hear about Oracle "securing" an algorithm they don't understand for a platform that 170M Americans can't quit. 

###### As we continue to build at [Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/), we've launched [Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/) with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter.

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **TikTok 's "American Dream" Deal:** ByteDance jumps from $230B to $400B valuation as Trump orchestrates a deal where Oracle pretends to understand the algorithm while the Murdochs join the board 

  * **H-1B Nuclear Option:** Trump's $100K visa fee just broke India's $280B IT sector and sent tech workers racing to airports with 48-hour deadlines 

  * **AI Infrastructure Insanity:** OpenAI commits $450B through 2030 while DeepSeek trains GPT-4 level AI for $294K using leftover chips 

  * **Figure Hits $39B:** Humanoid robot startup valued more than Ford Motor Company despite robots that can barely high-five 

  * **SoftBank Fires Winners:** Vision Fund axes 20% of staff after best quarter since 2021 to feed Masa's $500B Stargate addiction

### 📱 The Deal That Makes WeWork Look Financially Responsible

After months of threatening to ban TikTok,[ Trump announced a deal structure](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/22/tiktok-bytedance-trump-algorithm-lease): 

  * **The Board:** 6 Americans, 1 ByteDance rep who's excluded from the security committee 

  * **The Investors:** Oracle, Silver Lake, A16Z, and somehow the Murdochs 

  * **The Algorithm:** ByteDance creates a copy, leases it to the US entity, and Oracle "secures" it 

  * **The Timeline:** Another 120-day extension, because why not 




### 💰 ByteDance's $170B Victory Lap

[ByteDance's valuation rocketed from $230B to $400B](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-22/no-golden-share-for-trump-in-tiktok-deal-white-house-says) on news of the deal, with the math not adding up: 

  * **Ownership** : ByteDance keeps &lt;20% but somehow gains $170B in value 

  * **Control** : US investors get majority control of an algorithm they're leasing 

  * **Verification** : Oracle gets to "verify the retraining" of code that probably has more parameters than they have employees 

  * **Audience** : 170M Americans keep their dopamine dispenser 




### 🤔 The "National Security" Theater

Press Sec Karoline Leavitt claims they're[ "100% confident" the deal is done](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/20/us-china-tiktok-deal) and the algorithm will be "controlled by America." Meanwhile: 

  * The algorithm is still owned by ByteDance 

  * It's being leased, not sold 

  * Oracle is handling security who had a major security breach in 2023 

  * The Murdochs are somehow involved in national security now 




**Reality Check:** This isn't protecting America from China. It's protecting America from having to explain to 170M voters why their favorite app disappeared before the 2026 midterms. 

## 💣 The $100K H-1B Bomb: When "America First" Costs More Than a Tesla

[Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on H1B on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1872860577057448306?lang=en)

### 🎯 Trump's Nuclear Option on Tech Talent

In a late Friday news dump that sent tech executives into cardiac arrest, [Trump signed an EO imposing a $100K fee on H-1B visas:](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/20/trump-h-1b-visa-tech-foreign-governments.html)

  * Amazon (14K+ H-1B employees), Google, and Microsoft sent urgent memos: "GET BACK TO THE US NOW"

  * Deadline: Sept 21 at midnight (48-hour window) 

  * JPMorgan told employees to cancel all international travel indefinitely 

  * Tech workers are literally racing to airports 




**Commerce Sec Howard Lutnick 's Hot Take:** "Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs."

### 💸 The Math That Breaks India's Entire Business Model

[India's $280B IT services sector just watched its business model get obliterated:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-21/trump-s-100-000-visa-threatens-business-model-of-india-it-firms)

  * Indian IT firms typically make $15-20K profit per H-1B worker 

  * The $100K fee = 5-6 years of profit per employee 

  * Infosys and TCS's margins just went from "tight" to "nonexistent"

  * Over 70% of H-1B visas go to Indian nationals 




**Plot Twist:** India's government is already planning retaliatory measures, because nothing says "trade war" like weaponizing visa programs. 

### 🌏 The Unintended Consequences Speedrun

While Big Tech can absorb $100K/employee like a rounding error, here's who's actually screwed: early-stage startups, biotech companies, universities, and hospitals. 

**What Actually Happens Next:**

  1. **Offshoring Boom:** Hire entire teams in India over paying $100K+ salaries 

  2. **Canada/Mexico Arbitrage:** Start "near-shoring" talent from our neighbors 

  3. **Remote Work Victory:** Remote work has a resurgence as Zoom doesn't need a visa 

  4. **Startup Exodus:** Incorporate in Toronto over Delaware to avoid the fees 




**The Bottom Line:** In trying to save US jobs, Trump just made US companies uncompetitive, accelerated offshoring, and turned the H-1B into a luxury product that only the Mag 7 can afford. 

## 🤖 The AI Infrastructure Arms Race: When $450B Isn't Enough

[OpenAI & NVIDIA Announce Strategic Partnership to Deploy 10GW of NVIDIA Systems](https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/)

### 💸 Everyone's Writing Blank Checks to Nvidia

The AI infrastructure spending is entering "monopoly money" territory with [OpenAI committing $450B through 2030](https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/) and signing a[ $100B partnership with Nvidia](https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/) for 10GW of compute. 

**The Spending Insanity:**

  * **OpenAI** : $350B for training/inference + $100B for "backup servers" = $450B total 

  * **Nvidia-OpenAI** : Nvidia "invests" $100B in OpenAI... as OpenAI buys $100B of Nvidia chips (circular economy at its finest) 

  * **Meta** : $20B to Oracle + $10B to Google + $600B on own servers = "yes"

  * **Oracle** : Collecting checks from everyone: OpenAI ($300B), Meta ($20B), and xAI (undisclosed) 




**Sam Altman:** "Everything starts with compute."

**Translation:** "Jensen Huang owns my soul."

### 🤯 Plot Twist: DeepSeek Trained GPT-4 Level AI for $294K

While Silicon Valley burns GDP-sized piles of cash,[ Chinese startup, DeepSeek](https://x.com/_thatstartupguy/status/1970105682012635536), just announced they trained their reasoning model for **$294K** using 512 Nvidia H800 chips. 

**The Implication:** Either everyone else is monumentally inefficient, or DeepSeek figured something fundamental out. Given that OpenAI needs $100B in "backup servers" for "unforeseen breakthroughs," we're betting on the former. 

### 🐉 China's Response: Build Smarter, Not Richer

Faced with US sanctions, [China is building a distributed AI grid](https://www.ft.com/content/31b8d6d8-adb0-4db0-a292-422c5a3bff19) connecting regional clusters via Huawei's networking tech. Their Wuhu cluster's $37B investment looks quaint next to US spending, but when you can train GPT-4 for $294K, they may be onto something. 

**The Bottom Line:** We're watching the largest infrastructure buildout in history, where OpenAI alone plans to spend more than Norway's GDP, while a Chinese startup proved you could do it for less than a Bay Area house down payment. 

## ⚡ Startup Quick Hits: From Robot Billions to Tiny Home Millions

🚀 [xAI's $200B Valuation Despite Executive Exodus](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/musks-xai-10-billion-at-200-billion-valuation.html)**:** Musk's AI company raised $10B at a $200B valuation (up from $150B in weeks), even as executives flee over "management concerns and unrealistic projections."

**💻**[ Groq Bags $750M at $6.9B for Being "Not Nvidia"](https://groq.com/news/groq-raises-750-million-as-inference-demand-surges)**:** The AI chip startup known for blazing-fast inference secured one of hardware's largest rounds ever. Their pitch: "We're 10x faster than GPUs for inference." The catch: Training still needs Nvidia. 

🤖[ Figure Hits $39B Valuation Because Humanoids Are So Hot Right Now](https://www.therobotreport.com/figure-ai-raises-1b-in-series-c-funding-toward-humanoid-robot-development/)**:** The SF-based robot maker raised over $1B Series C led by Parkway Venture Capital, with everyone from Nvidia to T-Mobile piling in. At the moment, their robots can barely walk. 

📊[ AppZen's $180M for Being "AI-First Since 2012"](https://news.crunchbase.com/fintech/agentic-ai-startup-appzen-seriesd/)**:** The finance automation startup raised Series D from Riverwood Capital, claiming they've been "AI-first" since founding. After 13 years and $290M raised, they're still doing expense reports and AP automation. 

**🏠**[ Samara's $34M for Backyard Tiny Homes](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/17/tiny-homes-samara-airbnb)**:** Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia's prefab housing startup raised Series B from Thrive Capital after hitting $100M revenue. They're shipping 10 homes/month in California with 7-18 month wait times. 

## ⚡ Investor Quick Hits: Everyone Wants Their Own Fund

**💰**[ Jack Altman's Lightning-Fast $275M Fund](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jack-altman-snags-275-million-for-new-ai-enterprise-fund-c438f405)**:** Sam's brother closed Alt Capital's second fund in ONE MONTH (most commitment talks happened in a single week). Jumping from $150M to $275M in under a year proves the Altman surname is basically a money printer. The fund’s focus will be on AI startups disrupting SaaS. 

🔪 [SoftBank Vision Fund Axes 20% of Staff Despite Best Quarter Since 2021](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/softbank-vision-fund-lay-off-20-employees-shift-bold-ai-bets-source-memo-say-2025-09-18/)**:** In peak SoftBank logic, the Vision Fund is laying off 60+ employees globally right after posting its strongest performance in years (thanks to Nvidia gains). Why? Masa Son needs bodies for his $500B Stargate fever dream with OpenAI. 

📈 [Robinhood Launches Venture Fund for Retail Investors](https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/introducing-robinhood-ventures/)**:** Robinhood wants to let retail investors buy startup equity through a NYSE-traded closed-end fund (ticker: RVI). Because if there's one thing retail investors need, it's access to illiquid, high-risk startup investments they can't properly diligence.
