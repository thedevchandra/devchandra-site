The tech world hit another historic milestone this week, with AI continuing to reshape everything from chip valuations to enterprise software. 

As we continue to build at [Context Ventures](https://www.contextvc.com/), we've launched [Startup Intros](https://www.startupintros.com/) with a simple mission: to help early-stage founders find the right investors, faster and smarter. 

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **Nvidia Makes History:** Chip giant hits $3.92T, becoming the most valuable company ever 

  * **Elon 's AI War:** Musk's xAI raises $10B to battle his former company OpenAI 

  * **VC AI Gold Rush:** Menlo Ventures raises $1.5B specifically for AI investments 

  * **Figma 's Revenge Plot:** Design platform files for IPO after Adobe's failed $20B acquisition 

  * **Grammar Meets Email:** Grammarly acquires premium email client Superhuman to expand productivity suite 

  * **Enterprise Software Revolution:** AI-powered ERP startups raise millions to challenge SAP and Oracle 




## 🚀 Nvidia Became the Most Valuable Company Ever (Thanks, AI)

Hold onto your GPUs, as [Nvidia just made history by briefly becoming the most valuable company ever](https://www.voronoiapp.com/markets/-Nvidia-Takes-the-Lead-AI-Boom-Propels-It-to-Worlds-Most-Valuable-Company-3054?utm_source=Voronoi&utm_campaign=1c76a7b7c8-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_VORO_NOTIFICATION_30_06_25&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_-ab735e35b9-452867870&mc_cid=1c76a7b7c8&_bhlid=ab5a01f7007e778539c8d3558a16420afe45ef6a). On July 3rd, it hit a market cap of **$3.92T** , surpassing Apple's previous record: 

  * **The Numbers are Impressive** : Currently, Nvidia remains strong at $3.89T, comfortably ahead of Microsoft ($3.71T) and Apple ($3.19T). To put this in perspective, Nvidia's market value now exceeds the value of every public company in the UK combined. 

  * **The Backstory is Wild:** Just three years ago, Nvidia was valued at $360B, but when ChatGPT barged onto the scene, everyone realized they needed AI chips for their data centers, and Nvidia skyrocketed from $360B to $3T in that time. 

  * **Plot Twist:** While Nvidia is printing cash, Microsoft is scaling back its in-house AI chip ambitions after its next-gen chip ("Braga") was delayed by at least six months. The delays are due to design changes, staffing shortages, and high employee turnover. 




The more valuable Nvidia becomes, the more it reveals how the entire global economy is revolving around AI, as Nvidia essentially controls the infrastructure that makes AI possible. 

## 🤖 The AI Money Machine

### 💰 Elon's AI War Chest Gets $10B Bigger

When Elon Musk wants to win and build a "maximally truth-seeking" AI to compete, he does not mess around. [xAI just raised a whopping $10B](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/01/elon-musk-xai-raises-10-billion-in-debt-and-equity.html?utm_source=grant.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=will-apple-outsource-ai-for-siri&_bhlid=4d9ca1570f520144cd8b73b50f71e6be7f78523e) (half debt, half equity): 

  * **The Numbers Tell a Story:** Being one of the largest funding rounds ever, xAI sits at a $45-50B valuation with its total funding to $12B in just two years. 

  * **The Competition** : It puts xAI in the big leagues behind Anthropic ($18.2B raised, $61.5B valuation) and OpenAI ($17.9B raised, $300B valuation). 

  * **The Infrastructure & Talent Play:** With this capital, xAI can pursue ambitious research and attract top AI talent. Also, they plan to build a 1M GPU facility in addition to the 200,000 GPUs at their Colossus supercomputer in Memphis. 




The sheer size indicates that AI investment continues to reach unprecedented levels. Plus, the debt/equity mix gives xAI a lot of flexibility while keeping ownership control, positioning them to directly challenge Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic. 

### 🤖 More VCs Are Going All-In on AI

[Menlo Ventures just decided to raise $1.5B specifically to bet on AI ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/menlo-ventures-in-market-for-next-set-of-funds-with-ai-focus-e4af9c19?mod=venture-capital_lead_story&tpl=vc&utm_source=confluencevcweekly.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=modern-mechanics-for-max-leverage&_bhlid=b3b7ba7b59f462149db4a5a29ab48058e0794ea4)startups: 

  * **The Breakdown:** They're splitting this into $650M for early-stage AI startups and $850M for later-stage companies to diversify between "wild AI experiments" and "actually profitable AI businesses."

  * **But Wait, There 's More:** Menlo launched a $100M "Anthology Fund" with Anthropic that gives startups money plus $25K in compute credits and access to cutting-edge AI models. 




Instead of funding foundational AI (chips, models, infrastructure), Menlo is betting on companies that use AI to solve real-world problems in healthcare, finance, and consumer applications. 

## 📈 IPOs & Public Markets

[Figma's S-1: A PLG Powerhouse](https://tomtunguz.com/figma-s1-analysis/) by Thomas Tunguz

### 🎨 Figma's Revenge Era

Remember when regulators killed Adobe's $20B attempt to acquire Figma in 2024? Well, guess who just filed to go public at a higher value than Adobe was willing to pay? 

  * **The Plot Twist:** [Figma dropped its S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579878/000162828025033742/figma-sx1.htm), officially announcing plans to list on the NYSE under the ticker "FIG."

  * **The Numbers are Spicy:** Figma pulled in $749M in revenue last year (up 48% from 2023) with 13M monthly active users and a huge 91% gross margin. Compare that to Adobe's $21.5B revenue but only 11% growth, Figma is 3% the size but growing 4x faster. 

  * [What Makes Figma Special](https://tomtunguz.com/figma-s1-analysis/): Their sales efficiency is 1.0, meaning every dollar spent on sales and marketing in 2023 generated a dollar of new gross profit in 2024. Adobe's more traditional model only hits 0.39. Also, Figma's R&D; spend nearly equals its marketing spend, and the product essentially sells itself. 

  * **But There 's More:** Figma mentioned AI over 150 times in their filing, and they're holding $69.5M in Bitcoin ETFs. Their 132% net dollar retention puts them in the top decile of SaaS companies. 




Based on growth multiples, analysts predict that Figma could reach a $21B valuation, surpassing Adobe's original offer. It's a chance for retail investors to own the collaborative design platform that's expanding beyond design. 

## 🏢 Enterprise & M&A; Madness

[Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/)

### 📧 When Grammar Meets Superhuman Speed

[Grammarly just bought Superhuman](https://www.reuters.com/business/grammarly-acquires-email-startup-superhuman-ai-platform-push-2025-07-01/?_bhlid=6e98da5f2944aed53ed21a3760e5e03b8930ed43), the $30-a-month email client that convinced people to pay premium prices for email: 

  * **The Backstory:** Back in 2019, Superhuman founder Rahul Vohra charged $30 monthly for an email app optimized for keyboard shortcuts. The waiting list hit 200,000 people who wanted to feel like hackers while checking email. 

  * **Why This Makes Sense:** Grammarly is pivoting from "the thing that fixes typos" to "the AI that handles all communication." After ChatGPT, Grammarly's 30M daily users faced a choice: polish drafts or let AI write everything. 




This follows Grammarly's acquisition of AI-agent startup Coda last year, funded by $1B from General Catalyst. They're building what Rahul calls "the AI-native productivity suite of choice."

### 📶 ERP Gets a Glow-Up (Finally)

Enterprise software is typically about as user-friendly as assembling IKEA furniture blindfolded, but ERP startups are changing that: 

  * **Case in Point:** Tailor raised $22M to reimagine company operations with a "headless" ERP. They separated the user interface from the backend, allowing companies to select interfaces while the backend handles inventory, accounting, and workflows. 

  * **The Timing is Perfect:** CEO Yo Shibata predicts AI will handle 90% of operational tasks soon (currently 50%), so businesses want adaptable systems. Their system, Omakase, lets AI agents automate tasks via API. 

  * **Plot Twist:** Another ERP startup called Campfire just raised $35M for a similar AI-first approach. The "boring business software" space is having a moment. 




When 4-year-old startups are making enterprise giants sweat, the software revolution is already here.
