## 👑 Claude's Coronation: Anthropic's Breakout Week

### 📈 The Numbers That Matter

[Similarweb data shows Claude's web audience more than doubled YoY in December 2025](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-claude-code-ai-7a46460e), with the WSJ reporting that many coders spent their holiday breaks on a "Claude bender" testing Claude Opus 4.5. That's not marketing; that's developers voting with their keyboards. 

**The Fundraise:**[Sources tell the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/53220829-2ab2-471c-9a00-30d24beb8d48) that Sequoia is planning a major investment in Anthropic, joining a round led by GIC and Coatue (investing $1.5B each) as the company aims to raise $25B+. For context, that would be one of the largest private funding rounds in history. 

**The Product Expansion:**[Anthropic opened Claude Cowork to $20/month Pro subscribers](https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-opens-up-its-claude-cowork-feature-to-anyone-with-a-20-subscription-194000021.html) this week, after initially launching it only for Max users. The caveat is that Pro users "may hit their usage limits sooner." So it seems that demand is outstripping capacity. 

**The Talent Magnet:**[Andrea Vallone, OpenAI's former Head of Model Policy](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/862402/openai-safety-lead-model-policy-departs-for-anthropic-alignment-andrea-vallone), joined Anthropic's alignment team. When your competitor's safety leadership keeps defecting to you, the market is sending a message. 

### 💀 The SaaS Reckoning

Claude's rise has a body count: software stocks. [Bloomberg reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-18/-no-reasons-to-own-software-stocks-sink-on-fear-of-new-ai-tool) that Claude Cowork has revived fears about AI disruption, with Morgan Stanley's SaaS index now down 15% YTD. [Doug O'Laughlin at Fabricated Knowledge](https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/the-death-of-software-20-a-better) called it an "extinction-level event" for horizontal software companies. Adobe's stock has slumped 45%+ since the end of 2023, with [analysts now the most bearish since 2013](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/adobe-analysts-turn-most-bearish-since-2013-as-ai-threat-looms). 

**Translation:** The market isn't just pricing in competition; it's pricing in obsolescence. When a SaaS index drops 15% in three weeks because of one product launch, investors are betting that AI agents don't just compete with software; they replace the need for it.

## 📺 OpenAI's Advertising Pivot: ChatGPT Gets Commercials

[OpenAI: Our approach to advertising and expanding access to ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/)

OpenAI is done pretending subscriptions are enough. 

### 📢 The Ad Play

[The Financial Times reports](https://t.co/qWMhWBYbKz) that OpenAI plans to test ads beneath ChatGPT replies for users on the free and Go tiers in the US. A source says OpenAI expects to generate "low billions" in ad revenue in 2026. [Wired clarifies](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-testing-ads-us/) that ads will match conversation topics using personalization data, but OpenAI claims it won't sell user data or expose conversations to advertisers. 

**The Global Push:**[OpenAI expanded ChatGPT Go to the US and rest of the world](https://www.theverge.com/news/863466/openai-chatgpt-go-global-release) this week at $8/month, creating a new tier between free (with ads) and Pro ($20/month). 

**The Scale Context:** OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar [revealed](https://openai.com/index/a-business-that-scales-with-the-value-of-intelligence) that compute grew from 0.2 GW in 2023 to ~1.9 GW in 2025, while annualized revenue grew from $2B to $20B+. At that burn rate, ads aren't optional; they're necessary. 

### 🔧 The Hardware Angle

[OpenAI issued RFPs to US hardware manufacturers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-15/openai-seeks-us-based-suppliers-for-planned-robotics-ai-device-push) for consumer devices, robotics, and data centers. Executive Chris Lehane [confirmed](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/19/openai-device-2026-lehane-jony-ive) the company is "on track" to unveil its first device in H2 2026, with reports suggesting it will be a screenless wearable. 

**Translation:** OpenAI's business model is evolving from "charge power users" to "monetize everyone." Ads for free users, $8 for casual users, $20 for pro users, $200 for power users, and eventually hardware. They're not building a chatbot; they're building an ecosystem. 

## 💥 Thinking Machines Lab: The Wheels Come Off

[Bloomberg Originals: Inside OpenAI, the Architect of ChatGPT, featuring Mira Murati | The Circuit with Emily Chang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9Q5a1Vn-Hk)

What started as a promising AI lab is turning into a cautionary tale about founder drama. 

### 🚪 The Exodus

[The Information reports](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/thinking-machines-exodus-tests-investor-appetite-50-billion-valuation) that after five staff left, investors are rattled, potentially impacting the company's $50B valuation fundraise. The kicker: two researchers quit via Slack during an all-hands meeting. [Sources tell Alex Heath](https://sources.news/p/thinking-machines-is-nothing-without) the company lacks a clear product or business strategy. 

**The CTO Drama:**[Wired reported](https://www.wired.com/story/thinking-machines-lab-cofounder-office-relationship-firing-openai/) that leaders confronted co-founder Barret Zoph over an alleged relationship with another employee in the summer of 2025. Zoph has since returned to OpenAI, along with two other co-founders. [At least two more employees](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-openai-raid-on-thinking-machines-lab/) are expected to follow, with some researchers citing exhaustion from "the industry's constant drama."

**Translation:** Thinking Machines went from $50B valuation target to an existential crisis in weeks. When co-founders leave for the competition, researchers quit during all-hands, and investors smell blood, the product doesn't matter.

### 💭 Parting Thoughts: The Year Starts With a Warning

This week made one thing clear: the AI industry is consolidating around winners and losers faster than anyone expected. 

**Anthropic is winning.** Claude's audience doubled, Sequoia is piling in, and OpenAI's safety talent keeps defecting. The SaaS index dropping 15% in three weeks isn't a correction; it's the market recognizing that AI agents are coming for the software industry's lunch. 

**OpenAI is adapting.** Ads, hardware, new pricing tiers; they're building every monetization lever they can find because $20B in revenue still isn't enough when you're burning through gigawatts of compute. 

**Thinking Machines is a warning.** A $50B valuation means nothing when your co-founders leave, your researchers quit on Slack, and investors smell blood. 

The next few months will separate the companies building durable businesses from those riding hype cycles, so place your bets accordingly.
