## 🚫 The Digital Iron Curtain: China's $50B Silicon Purge

### 🔨 From Chip Ban to 50% Power Bribes: China's Tech Divorce

China just[ banned all foreign AI chips from state-funded data centers](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-bans-foreign-ai-chips-state-funded-data-centres-sources-say-2025-11-05/) while simultaneously[ slashing power bills by 50%](https://t.co/3qo3LvWSUK) for companies ditching Nvidia: 

  * **100% Domestic Mandate:** New state-funded data centers must use only Chinese AI chips 

  * **Rip-and-Replace Orders:** Projects under 30% completion must remove already-installed foreign chips 

  * **50% Power Discount:** Alibaba & ByteDance get half-price electricity if they switch to Huawei & Cambricon 

  * **The Catch:** Domestic chips burn more power per computation than banned US alternatives 




**The Beautiful Irony:** Chinese chips can't match Nvidia's performance per watt, so they're burning more power while computing less. But when the government cuts your electricity bill in half, suddenly that efficiency gap no longer matters. The US spent three years perfecting export controls. China's spending billions to make them irrelevant. 

### 🎰 Chinese AI Models Outtraded GPT-5 by 85 Percentage Points

[Chinese AI models from DeepSeek and Alibaba crushed Western rivals in live crypto trading](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3330461/deepseek-and-qwen-ai-models-crush-western-rivals-cryptocurrency-trading-challenge), with Qwen3-Max delivering +22.32% returns while OpenAI's GPT-5 hemorrhaged -62.66%: 

  * **Qwen3-Max:** +22.32% returns (without advanced reasoning features) 

  * **DeepSeek V3.1:** +4.89% gains in real market conditions 

  * **GPT-5:** -62.66% losses (worst performer in the competition) 

  * **All US Models:** Every American model (GPT-5, Gemini, Claude, xAI) lost money 




**The Setup:** Six AI models, each with $10K, traded crypto-perpetual contracts on Hyperliquid for two weeks. All trades were logged publicly in real-time, eliminating backtest trickery. 

**Reality Check:** While organizers cautioned that two weeks is statistically thin, this wasn't a lab benchmark test. This was real money, real markets, and real-time decisions. China's "cheap" AI models just outtraded America's best in the financial arena that matters most. 

### 🌐 Xi Proposes an "AI United Nations" Headquartered in Shanghai

[Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed a "World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization"](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-pushes-global-ai-body-apec-counter-us-2025-11-01/) at the APEC summit, positioning China to write global AI governance rules: 

  * **Headquarters:** Shanghai becomes the capital of AI diplomacy 

  * **Target Audience:** Developing countries tired of Western-dominated tech standards 

  * **Real Agenda:** "Algorithmic sovereignty" and control over who sets the rules 

  * **The Pitch:** Make AI a "public good" while China writes the rulebook 




**Translation:** While the US favors national regulation and loose international standards, China wants a multilateral body where it plays kingmaker. The tech cold war isn't just about chips and export controls anymore; it's about who writes the global constitution for artificial intelligence. 

## 💸 The Great VC Concentration: When AI Eats Everything

### 🤖 AI Vacuums 46% of All VC While Megarounds Swallow the Rest

[AI startups captured a staggering $45B in Q3 2025](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/state-of-startups-q3-2025-ai-megarounds-charts-data/), representing 46% of the entire $97B in global VC funding, while megarounds of $100M+ now account for a record 60% of all capital: 

  * **$45B to AI:** Nearly half of all venture dollars went to one sector in three months 

  * **$13B to Anthropic:** A single company captured 29% of all AI investment globally 

  * **60% to Megarounds:** The highest share ever recorded in Crunchbase history 

  * **70% US Megarounds:** 7 out of 10 US VC dollars flow to $100M+ rounds 

  * **$15.8B to Biotech:** Record low for a sector that used to compete for top billing 




**Reality Check:** VC isn't really "venture" anymore when two-thirds of the money goes to established AI giants raising billion-dollar rounds. When one company (Anthropic) raises more than entire sectors, and 60% of capital goes to a handful of mega-bets, the whole ecosystem becomes a high-stakes poker game with only a few hands. 

### 💰 October's $39B: NYC Beats the Bay, OpenAI Hits $500B

[October delivered $39B in global startup funding](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-startup-funding-heats-up-october-2025-reflection-polymarket/) with nine $500M+ rounds, while NYC unexpectedly dominated mega-deals and OpenAI's secondary sale added $500B to its valuation: 

  * **$5.9B to NYC:** Up 200%+ YoY, beating the Bay Area for largest deals 

  * **$2B to Reflection AI:** Nvidia-backed coding agent (NYC, not SF) 

  * **$2B to Polymarket:** Prediction market backed by NYSE parent ICE 

  * **$3.9B to China:** Up 200%+ despite chip wars and export controls 

  * **$500B OpenAI Valuation:** Secondary sale added hundreds of billions to Crunchbase Unicorn Board 




**Reality Check:** When NYC startups raise more in mega-rounds than the Bay for the first time in memory, you're either witnessing genuine geographic diversification or watching East Coast founders master the art of billion-dollar fundraising. The $39B total is up from $34B a year ago but down from September's $51B, suggesting the mega-round mania is plateauing. 

### 🎰 Tech Giants & Big Pharma Play VC to Avoid Antitrust Headaches

[The Big 5 Tech Giants have pivoted from acquisitions to accumulating massive startup stakes](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/big-five-huge-startup-stakes-nvda-aapl-msft-goog-amzn/), with Microsoft's $135B OpenAI position proving minority investing beats FTC lawsuits: 

  * **$135B Microsoft Stake:** 27% of OpenAI is worth 6x more than Meta's WhatsApp acquisition 

  * **208 Deals in 2025:** Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon made $70B in total investments 

  * **$8B Amazon Bet:** Anthropic commitment tripled in value as valuation hit $183B 

  * **$18T Combined Market Cap:** They can afford any acquisition but choose strategic stakes instead 




**Biotech Funding** : [Collapsed to just 8% of total US VC](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/biotech-us-funding-share-lowest-2025/), forcing complete reliance on[ corporate VC arms from pharmaceutical giants](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/corporate-venture-capital-biotech-startup-funding/804015/): 

  * **8% Share:** Down from the historical norm of 15-20% of annual VC funding 

  * **$16.6B Total:** Biotech's entire 2025 haul, while total VC funding increased 

  * **Corporate Takeover:** Novo Holdings, Eli Lilly, Sanofi, and Pfizer now control early-stage biotech 

  * **18 IPOs:** Anemic exits putting 2025 on pace for historic low 




**The Antitrust Workaround:** Why spend $20B acquiring a startup and trigger antitrust when you can invest $10B, watch it appreciate 13x, and control through cloud contracts? VC funding rose in 2025, but biotech got diluted as AI mega-rounds inflated the denominator. The market decided incremental LLM improvements are 10x more fundable than curing diseases. Thus, the conflicts write themselves when incumbents fund alternatives.

### 💭 Parting Thoughts

The chip war has just evolved from export controls to economic incentives that make them irrelevant. China's spending billions to turn US sanctions into a competitive advantage while its "cheap" AI models are outtrading the US models for real money. 

Meanwhile, VC has become venture concentration, with AI hoovering 46% of all funding while Big Tech deploys minority stakes like chess pieces to avoid antitrust checkmate.
