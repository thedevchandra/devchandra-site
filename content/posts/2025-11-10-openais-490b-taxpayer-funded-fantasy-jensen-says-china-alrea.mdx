This week in Silicon Valley, Startups & Tech: 

  * **OpenAI 's $490B Tax Credit Fantasy:** Lobbies for 35% CHIPS Act credits on $1.4T infrastructure spend, CFO suggests loan guarantees, AI czar kills it dead 

  * **China Already Won (According to Nvidia 's CEO):** Jensen Huang declares China "nanoseconds behind" while the US blocks even compliance-built chips 

  * **The Great AI Bailout Debate:** OpenAI wants taxpayers to split the bill while projecting "hundreds of billions" in 2030 revenue that doesn't exist yet 

  * **Sequoia 's Imperial Collapse:** Roelof Botha ousted over leadership style and AI strategy as venture capital's kingmakers discover limits 

  * **Google 's $350B Anthropic Bet:** Early talks at 100x markup from initial investment, because watching Microsoft have all the AI fun got expensive

## 💸 The $1.4T Bill OpenAI Wants You to Split

[The All-in Podcast: Does OpenAI Need a Bailout?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uYEPfiBMAE)

### 🏦 OpenAI Discovers Tax Credits Are Just Bailouts With Better Branding

[OpenAI's chief global affairs officer sent the White House a letter in October 2025](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-07/openai-asks-us-to-expand-chips-act-tax-credit-to-ai-data-centers) asking to expand the CHIPS Act's 35% Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit to cover AI data centers, servers, and grid infrastructure. 

  * **$1.4T:** OpenAI's planned US infrastructure investment through 2033 

  * **$490B** : Amount of the investment that OpenAI wants taxpayers to subsidize 

  * **$175B annually:** What they need to average to meet commitments 

  * **35% Cash Back:** What semiconductor fabs currently get and what AI companies now want 




**Reality Check:** The CHIPS Act was designed to reshore semiconductor manufacturing, but it’s turning into an AI infra subsidy program. OpenAI projects "multi-hundred-billion" revenue by 2030, yet the capital intensity is so extreme that they're actively lobbying for federal tax credits. 

## 💬 OpenAI's CFO Says the Quiet Part Loud, Issues LinkedIn Correction

[Days later, CFO Sarah Friar accidentally escalated the ask at a Wall Street Journal event](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/openai-cfo-sarah-friar-says-company-is-not-seeking-government-backstop.html), suggesting the government should "backstop" OpenAI's infrastructure loans. Within 48 hours, both Friar and CEO Sam Altman were doing damage control on LinkedIn. 

**The Distinction:** They want tax credits, not loan guarantees, a significant difference compared to Solyndra. But when your CFO accidentally proposes government loan guarantees at a public event, you've revealed exactly how astronomical the spending has become. 

### 🚫 Trump's AI Czar Torpedoes Any Bailout Dreams

[White House AI czar David Sacks killed the bailout fantasy](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/trump-ai-sacks-federal-bailout-openai-friar.html), declaring that if one of the five major AI companies collapses, the others will simply absorb the scraps. So if you're raising hundreds of billions in capital, don't come crying to taxpayers when the burn rate catches up. 

**What DC Will Actually Do:**

  * **Yes:** Accelerate infrastructure permitting, expand power generation, broaden manufacturing tax credits 

  * **No:** Write checks or guarantee loans for struggling AI labs 




**The Timing:** This dropped right after Friar's "backstop" trial balloon. Nothing says confidence in your business model like hinting at federal guarantees while raising capital at a $300B valuation. 

### 💪 Altman's Bold Bet: "We'll Fund It With Revenue That Doesn't Exist Yet"

[Sam Altman rejected government guarantees](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-06/altman-says-openai-doesn-t-want-a-government-bailout-for-ai), insisting OpenAI will fund everything through revenue expected to hit "hundreds of billions by 2030." Bold words for $1.4T in commitments over eight years. 

  * **Current Revenue:** $20B+ annualized run rate 

  * **2030 Projection:** "Hundreds of billions"

  * **The Gap:** Betting on 10x revenue growth to fund commitments made today 




**The Kicker:** OpenAI still wants DC’s help, just not direct bailouts. They're lobbying for broader manufacturing tax credits. Nothing says "we don't need government support" quite like betting $1.4T on future revenue while asking for 35% tax credits on capex. 

## 🌍 The AI Stack Fractures Into Separate Civilizations

[“China Will Win”: Nvidia CEO’s Stark Verdict on the AI Race | Vantage with Palki Sharma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TeJtrWiNAQ)

### 🇨🇳 Nvidia's CEO Declares China Already Won

[Jensen Huang told the Financial Times that "China is going to win the AI race,"](https://www.ft.com/content/53295276-ba8d-4ec2-b0de-081e73b3ba43) arguing US chip export bans aren't slowing Beijing down; they're turbocharging domestic innovation. The CEO whose chips power 90% of global AI training says China is only "nanoseconds behind America" and accelerating. 

**Huang 's Thesis:** Export controls promote Chinese self-sufficiency rather than dependence. China offers massive energy subsidies and streamlined approvals, while Western "cynicism" about AI creates regulatory paralysis. 

**The Irony:** Nothing says "export controls are working" like the world's leading AI chip CEO declaring your adversary has already won. The ban, intended to preserve US dominance, may be creating exactly the bifurcated AI future it sought to prevent. 

### 🚧 DC Moves the Goalposts: Even Compliant Chips Banned Now

[The White House will block Nvidia's sale of scaled-down B30A chips to China](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/u-s-block-nvidias-sale-scaled-back-ai-chips-china), or the chips specifically engineered to comply with existing restrictions. DC still said no. 

  * **First Wave:** Ban flagship H100 and A100 chips 

  * **Second Wave:** Block "compliant" versions (H800, A800, L40S) 

  * **Now:** Even deliberately gimped chips are too powerful 




**Reality Check:** The US is systematically bifurcating the AI hardware stack. Every new restriction validates China's decade-long push for semi self-sufficiency. We're forcing both sides to build completely separate tech ecosystems from the silicon up. 

### ⚛️ China Weaponizes the Periodic Table, Then Negotiates a Timeout

[China suspended export restrictions on five critical minerals](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/business/china-suspends-export-controls.html) (gallium, germanium, antimony, rare earths, and graphite) following a November 2025 trade agreement. The suspension lasts until November 2026 with quarterly reviews. 

**What 's at Stake:** These materials are essential for semiconductor manufacturing, batteries, defense systems, and EV motors. China dominates the global processing of all five. 

**Reality Check:** This isn't a truce, as China just reminded the world that you can design the most sophisticated AI chip imaginable, but you can't manufacture it without their rocks. The AI stack is fracturing all the way down to the periodic table.
