What another great week in the Silicon Valley startup world! 

## 🎯 BLUF: Bottom Line Upfront

  * **The Startup Factory:** Y Combinator went from 17 startups per batch to 400+ industrialized chaos. 

  * **Pricing models are getting flipped** : 75% of software companies changed pricing last year as seat-based is dying. 

  * **Waiting Game:** VC funds from 2017 still haven't returned money to investors, and what this means below. 

  * **Corporate FOMO:** Fidelity launched a Carta competitor, but startup expertise can't be bought. 

  * **Robot Takeover:** Amazon's CEO casually announced that AI will reduce their total workforce. 

  * **Office Recall:** Remote-only startups dropped from 29% to 16% in one year 




## 🏭 Y Combinator Isn't What It Used to Be (And That's the Point)

_**Source:**__[Nate Matherson on LinkedIn​​](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/natematherson_y-combinator-batch-sizes-have-changed-%F0%9D%97%AE-activity-7282738428100718592-aL0F/)_

[Y Combinator went from funding 17 startups per batch to 400+](https://www.fastcompany.com/91279425/y-combinator-startup-accelerator-identity-crisis), and critics are calling it an identity crisis. The exclusive club that once made founders feel special is now more like a startup assembly line: 

  * **The numbers tell the story:** Early YC batches averaged 17 companies. Recent batches hit 414. That's not growth: that's industrialization. Plus, they're doubling down by moving to four batches per year this year. 

  * **The AI takeover:** 67% of YC's latest batch is "AI" companies, compared to 15% two years ago. Everyone may be building a similar ChatGPT wrapper with different fonts. 

  * **The dilution is real:** Investors are overwhelmed trying to evaluate hundreds of pitches at Demo Day. The YC label used to be like getting into Harvard. Now it's still valuable, just less exclusive. 

  * **Plot twist:** YC's success stats remain impressive, with 4.5% of startups becoming unicorns, compared to 2.5% for other startups. But valuations are reportedly "out of sync" with the bear market reality. 




YC traded exclusivity for scale, betting that casting a wider net will catch the next Airbnb. Whether that preserves or destroys their magic remains to be seen. 

Do you think it’s still worth it? 

## 💸 RIP Traditional Seat-Based SaaS Pricing: The Great Revenue Model Shakeup

[A survey of 240 software companies](https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/2025-state-of-b2b-monetization?utm_source=confluencevcweekly.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-state-of-b2b-monetization-in-2025) reveals the massive shift away from traditional seat-based pricing as AI transforms value delivery. Here are the key findings 

  * **Traditional Models Are Dying:** Seats and flat-rate pricing dropped from 50% to 37% as AI decouples value creation from human headcount and subscription predictability. 

  * **Constant Evolution Required:** 75% of companies changed pricing models last year, yet few have adequate team resources or tooling to maintain the required pricing agility. 

  * **The Transparency Paradox** : Despite demand for transparency, complex hybrid models with AI credits are actually driving buyers toward human sales conversations rather than just buying on the website. 

  * **Hybrid Becomes the New Standard:** Usage-based pricing combined with subscriptions surged from 27% to 41%, establishing hybrid models as the go-to approach. 

  * **Endless Customization Options:** From pay-as-you-go with caps, to platform fees plus usage, the best companies are matching their pricing to their specific cost structures and customer behaviors. 

  * **Outcome-Based Pricing Wins** : While only 5% currently use outcome-based models, 25% expect adoption within three years as AI agents demonstrate measurable ROI. 




## ⏳ VC Funds Are Playing the Long Game (And It's Getting Awkward)

[Carta's Q1 2025 VC fund performance report](https://carta.com/data/vc-fund-performance-q1-2025-full-report/?stream=top) is giving "we're still figuring this out" energy: 

  * 2017 funds are sitting at 11.5% IRR and have grown investments 1.72x on paper, but they've only returned 27 cents per dollar to investors. 

  * Only 37% of 2019 funds and 30% of 2020 funds have given investors ANY money back. 

  * **Plot twist:** Funds are getting smaller, as nearly half are now tiny, $1-10M funds, versus the $25-100M sweet spot in 2020. 




The VC world is in its awkward teenage phase: not quite mature enough for consistent returns. 

## 🏢 Fidelity Just Entered the Chat (But Should You Care?)

I have been seeing the Fidelity advertising everywhere (this is from the HubSpot AI Summit), and honestly, it feels desperate: 

  * The giant launched [Fidelity Private Shares](https://www.fidelityprivateshares.com/) as a competitor to Carta, but being big doesn't necessarily make you better at startups. 

  * **The reality:** Carta spent a decade figuring out founder problems. Fidelity is starting from scratch with a borrowed playbook and a corporate customer service approach. 




Most startup problems can't be solved by throwing money at them—they need people who've been in the trenches. 

## 🤖 Amazon's CEO Just Said the Quiet Part Out Loud About AI

[Andy Jassy told Amazon employees that AI will "reduce our total corporate workforce"](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-on-generative-ai) in the years to come. Nothing says "embrace change" like casual job elimination announcements. 

  * Amazon has over 1,000 AI projects in development—from smarter Alexa to AI agents that handle research and coding. 

  * Jassy wants to operate like "the world's largest startup," which historically has meant fewer people. 




He's telling employees to "be curious about AI," which is corporate speak for "adapt or become obsolete."

## 🏠 The Great Remote Work Retreat Is Here

Dylan Hughes from Sequoia on LinkedIn said that [fully remote startups are vanishing](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dylanhughes2_futureofwork-remotework-startups-activity-7336768873246937090-G93U/): 

  * Companies with under 50 employees dropped from 29% to just 16% remote-only in a single year. 

  * **Why the reversal?** Tax nightmares across multiple states, local talent abundance, security concerns, and investor pressure for in-person collaboration. 




The pandemic-era "work from anywhere" dream is colliding with business reality. Managing distributed teams is harder than it looked on Twitter.

## 💭 Parting Thoughts

Here are some ideas that stuck with me this week: 

  * **Scale kills magic:** Y Combinator's growth from 17 to 400+ companies proves that exclusivity and industrialization can't coexist, so choose wisely. 

  * **Everything 's getting repriced:** From SaaS seats to remote work to job security, AI is forcing every business model to evolve or die. 

  * **The waiting game continues:** Whether it's VC returns or finding the next unicorn, patience is still the startup world's scarcest commodity. 




**What 's your take? Are we in a golden age of AI innovation or on the verge of an inevitable correction?**
